How Secured Credit Cards Work
 
To fund your H-D™ Visa Secured Card, you can choose to:Fund online using your checking or savings account.
Print an application and mail a cashier’s check or money order. Personalchecks are not accepted.If your application is approved, we'll send you a credit card with a credit line the same amount as your deposit.The deposit is used to open a U.S. Bank secured savings account to ensure your card can be paid. The U.S. Bank secured savings account is FDIC-insured, earns interest and won't be touched as long as your account remains open and in good standing.
Purchases with the H-D™ Visa Secured Card are billed to you each month as with any credit card.
Payments are not automatically deducted from your secured savings account. You're responsible for making at least your minimum payment by the monthly due date.When you've managed all of your credit obligations responsibly and consistently for 12 months, you'll be well on your way to a stronger credit standing, and we may be able to move you to an unsecured credit card product.View Terms and Conditions
