 of prepaid cards, purchases of gift cards, person-to-person payments, or purcha
ses of any cash equivalents. Additional Card Members on your account are not eli

FIT TERMSThe following benefits and services are subject to change or cancellati
on.20% Extra Points BenefitHow the Benefit Works If you make 20 or more separate
 purchases of goods or services in a billing period with your Amex EveryDay® Cre
dit Card ("Card"), you earn 20% extra Membership Rewards points on those purchas
es less returns and credits with a date in that billing period. A transaction wh
ere you buy multiple items counts as one purchase. Purchases do not include fees
 or interest charges, balance transfers, cash advances, purchases of travelers c
hecks, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, or purchases of other cash equiv
alents. This benefit will not apply to any limited time promotions and offers (s
uch as a Welcome Bonus). Impact of Returns and Credits Returns and credits do no
t reduce your purchase count. Returns and credits will reduce the number of Memb
ership Rewards points and extra Membership Rewards points earned. Example: Suppo
se in a billing period you make 20 purchases totaling $500 and you return a $200
 item that you purchased in the same or a prior billing period. The return does 
not reduce your purchase count, but it does reduce the Membership Rewards points
 on those purchases from 500 to 300. So, in this example you would earn 20% extr
a on those 300 points. When Purchases Count To count purchases for this benefit,
 we use the date of the purchase. For example, if you make a purchase on the las
t day in your January billing period, it might not post to your account until yo
ur February billing period. If this happens, the purchase still counts towards y
our January billing period. In rare instances, a purchase may not post to your a
ccount for several billing periods. For example, extreme weather or other busine
ss disruptions may delay a merchant in submitting transactions to us. If a purch
ase posts to your account more than four billing periods after the purchase date
, we count it for the billing period in which it posts, and not the purchase dat
e. Some merchants combine separate charges into a single transaction before subm
itting it to us. When this happens, the combined transaction will count as a sin
gle purchase for purposes of counting towards 20 separate purchases. For example
, if you charge three items to your Card at the same online merchant at three se
parate times over one or more days, the merchant may combine those three charges
 and submit them as a single transaction. In that case, that combined transactio
n will count as one purchase. Transaction Dates A date of a purchase, return or 
credit may sometimes be different from the date you made the transaction. For ex
ample, if you buy goods online, the purchase date may be the date the goods are 
shipped. Also, if you use your Card while traveling (on a hotel, car rental, or 
while on a cruise), the purchase date may be the date you complete that travel.
