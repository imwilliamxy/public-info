("Purchases" do not include balance transfers, cash advances, travelers checks, foreign currency, money orders, wire transfers or similar cash-like transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting transactions, any checks that access your account, interest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if applicable.) To be eligible for this bonus offer, your card account must be open and not in default at the time of fulfillment. Chase is not responsible for offer fulfillment. If your card account is not open for at least 3 months, Hyatt and Chase reserve the right to deduct the Bonus Points from your World of Hyatt account. All World of Hyatt terms and conditions apply and are available at worldofhyatt.com/terms.                                                                        Earning Bonus Points                                                                        Rewards Program Agreement: For more information about the World of Hyatt Credit Card rewards program, view the latest Rewards Program Agreement. We will mail your Rewards Program Agreement once your account is established. If you become a Chase Online customer, your Rewards Program Agreement will also be available after logging in to chase.com.        How you can earn Bonus Points: You'll earn World of Hyatt Bonus Points when you, or an authorized user, use a World of Hyatt Credit Card to make purchases of products and services, minus returns or refunds. Buying products and services with your card, in most cases, will count as a purchase; however, the following types of transactions won't count as a purchase and won't earn World of Hyatt Bonus Points: balance transfers, cash advances and other cash-like transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting transactions, any checks that access your account, interest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if applicable. 4 Bonus Points: You'll earn 4 World of Hyatt Bonus Points for each $1 USD spent on purchases made at Hyatt hotels and resorts (including at participating restaurants and participating locations that are owned, managed, franchised or licensed by Hyatt Corporation or its subsidiaries or affiliates). 2 Bonus Points: You'll earn 2 World of Hyatt Bonus Points for each $1 USD spent on purchases made in any of the following rewards categories: restaurants (excluding dining purchases that qualify for 4 Bonus Points as described above); airline tickets when purchased directly with the airline; local transit/commuting; fitness club and gym memberships. 1 Bonus Point: You'll earn 1 World of Hyatt Bonus Point for each $1 spent on all other purchases. Information about earning/transferring Bonus Points to Hyatt: You must be a World of Hyatt member to receive and use Bonus Points, Free Night Awards, or other World of Hyatt Program benefits. If you are currently a World of Hyatt member, Bonus Points you earn through your World of Hyatt Credit Card will be deposited into your World of Hyatt Program account as described below. If you are not already a World of Hyatt member, Chase will provide your information to Hyatt upon approval of your World of Hyatt Credit Card application and Hyatt will enroll you in the World of Hyatt Program account. World of Hyatt Bonus Points earned through the World of Hyatt Credit Card can only be transferred to the primary card member's World of Hyatt Program account. World of Hyatt Bonus Points earned during a billing cycle will be automatically transferred to Hyatt after the end of each billing cycle and will be placed in the member's World of Hyatt Program account, at which point they will be available to be used. How you could lose Bonus Points that have not yet transferred to Hyatt: You'll immediately lose all World of Hyatt Bonus Points that haven't been transferred to your World of Hyatt Program account if your card account status changes, or your card account is closed for program misuse, fraudulent activities, failure to pay, bankruptcy, or other reasons described in the terms of the Rewards Program Agreement. Points expiration: The Bonus Points transferred to your World of Hyatt Program account won't expire as long as your card account is open. If your card account is closed, you will lose any unredeemed points (including Bonus Points) in your World of Hyatt Program account if you fail to have qualifying activity in the World of Hyatt Program at least once every 24 months. Please see the World of Hyatt Program Terms and Conditions at worldofhyatt.com/terms for details on how to keep your account active. Also, if your World of Hyatt Program account is terminated, any unredeemed points in your World of Hyatt Program account will be lost. Rewards Categories: Merchants who accept Visa/MasterCard credit cards are assigned a merchant code, which is determined by the merchant or its processor in accordance with Visa/MasterCard procedures based on the kinds of products and services they primarily sell. We group similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers to you. Please note: We make every effort to include all relevant merchant codes in our rewards categories. However, even though a merchant or some of the items that it sells may appear to fit within a rewards category, the merchant may not have a merchant code in that category. When this occurs, purchases with that merchant won't qualify for rewards offers on purchases in that category. Purchases submitted by you, an authorized user, or the merchant through third party payment accounts, mobile or wireless card readers, online or mobile digital wallets, or similar technology will not qualify in a rewards category if the technology is not set up to process the purchase in that rewards category. For more information about Chase rewards categories, see www.Chase.com/RewardsCategoryFAQs.
