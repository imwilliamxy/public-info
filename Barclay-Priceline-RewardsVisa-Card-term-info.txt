urity number, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may a
lso ask to see copies of identifying documents. We also ask for country of citiz
enship.Balance Transfers. Here's How it Works: To request a balance transfer ple
ase enter the 15/16 digit account number from the Mastercard, Visa, American Exp
ress, or Discover Card account that you want us to process a balance transfer fr
om. If the total amount you request exceeds the assigned credit line on your new
 account, we may either decline the request or send a partial payment to your cr
editor(s). The amount of available credit on your new account will be reduced by
 the amount transferred and the related balance transfer fees. We reserve the ri
ght to decline to process any requested balance transfer. We will not process a 
request to transfer a balance from any other account you may have with us. Balan
ce transfers incur interest from the transaction date. You should not transfer t
he amount of any disputed purchase or other charge. If you do, you may lose your
 dispute rights.Upon approval of your application we will process the requested 
balance transfer payment to the account(s) which you have requested on the 10th 
day after we've mailed you your card; during this 10 day time period you may can
cel your balance transfer by contacting us at the number on the back of your car
d. A balance transfer may take up to 4 weeks to post to your other accounts. Con
tinue to pay each creditor until the balance transfer appears on the other accou
nt as a credit. If you would like to complete a balance transfer from another ac
count that is not a Visa, Mastercard, American Express or Discover Card account,
 please call the phone number on the back of your new credit card once you are a
pproved. Balance transfers are subject to availability. We may deny balance tran
sfer requests at any time and for any reason.Avoiding Interest on Purchases: We 
will not charge you interest on any purchases if you pay your entire balance by 
the due date each month. In addition, during this introductory period we will no
t charge you interest on purchases if you pay by the due date each month your ou
tstanding statement balance minus any new 0% introductory APR Balance Transfer b
alances. To avoid a late fee, you should pay at least the minimum payment due on
 your account each month.Credit Limit: We do not permit applicants to request a 
specific credit limit. We do not consider a request for a balance transfer made 
with an application to be a request for a particular credit limit. We determine 
the credit limit on your account independent of and prior to processing any bala
nce transfer request.Cash Equivalent Purchases: The purchase of money orders, tr
avelers' checks, foreign currency, lottery tickets, gambling chips, wire transfe
rs and other similar transactions are treated as cash advances. Please see your
