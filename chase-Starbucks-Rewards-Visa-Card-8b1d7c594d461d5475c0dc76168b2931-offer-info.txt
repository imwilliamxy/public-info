          How you can earn Stars: You'll earn Stars when you, or an authorized user, use a Starbucks Rewards™ Visa Card to make purchases of products and services, minus returns or refunds. Buying products and services with your card, in most cases, will count as a purchase; however, the following types of transactions won't count and won't earn Stars: balance transfers, cash advances and other cash-like transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting transactions, any checks that access your account, interest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if applicable. 1 Star when loading funds to your Starbucks Card: You'll earn 1 Star for each $1 spent using the Starbucks Rewards Visa Card to load funds to your registered Starbucks Card through the Starbucks mobile app or at starbucks.com/card 1 Star for each $4 spent on all other purchases: You'll earn 1 Star for each $4 spent using the Starbucks Rewards Visa Card on all other purchases, including funds loaded to your registered Starbucks Card at a Starbucks retail store. "Starbucks Card" means physical Starbucks branded stored value cards available for sale from participating Starbucks locations and other retail locations; digital forms of the physical cards available through the Starbucks mobile app; or Starbucks Card eGifts that can be purchased at starbucks.com/shop/card/egift and allow you to load a dollar value for use at participating Starbucks locations. The dollar value you load onto your Starbucks Card is a prepayment for the goods and services of participating Starbucks locations. "Participating Starbucks locations" means all Starbucks locations that honor Starbucks Rewards. For stores that honor Starbucks Rewards, locate a store at starbucks.com and look for stores that list "Digital Rewards" as one of their amenities. Information about earning/transferring Stars to Starbucks: Stars earned during a billing cycle will be automatically transferred to Starbucks after the end of each billing cycle. Star expiration: The Stars earned in this Starbucks Rewards Visa Card rewards program that are transferred to your Starbucks Rewards Program account expire six (6) months after the calendar month in which they were earned. The Starbucks Rewards Program terms of use are available online at starbucks.com/card/rewards/rewards-program-ts-and-cs. Losing Stars: You'll immediately lose all Stars that haven't been transferred to Starbucks if your Starbucks Rewards Visa Card account status changes, or your Starbucks Rewards Visa Card account is closed for program misuse, fraudulent activities, failure to pay, bankruptcy, or other reasons described in the terms of the Rewards Program Agreement.
