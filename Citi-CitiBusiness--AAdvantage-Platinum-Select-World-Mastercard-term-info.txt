Identity Verification

                IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT - To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. This means that we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you when you open an account.  In addition, the bank must obtain the business' legal name, its street address, and its taxpayer identification number. We may also ask to see your driver's license or other identifying documents; and obtain identification information about you or any employees you add to your account.
