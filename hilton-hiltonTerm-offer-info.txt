 Hilton Honors Points can be earned for hotel stays only at hotels within the Hilton Portfolio. Participating hotels within the Hilton Portfolio are subject to change at any time, without notice. Consult individual hotel listing on Hilton.com or at HiltonHonors.com to determine participation. If a hotel ceases to be a hotel within the Hilton Portfolio, all stays subsequent to such date will not be eligible to earn Hilton Honors Points regardless of when the reservation was made.
 To earn Hilton Honors Points or credit toward tier status for hotel stays, a Member must be a registered, paying and staying guest at a participating hotel within the Hilton Portfolio and meet all of the conditions described herein. Members may also earn Hilton Honors Points for eligible charges to Hilton Honors credit cards, a list of such credit cards is available here, subject to terms outlined in their Cardmember Agreement. See the Credit Card Terms and Conditions for additional details. Points may also be earned for other activities as designated by Hilton Honors from time to time.
 A "stay" is defined as the total number of consecutive nights spent at the same hotel, whether or not a guest checks out and checks back in again. Specifically excluded from the definition of "stay" are the following types of ineligible stays:
 
  wholesale/tour operator packages;
  contracted crew rates;
  travel agency discount rates;
  packages exclusively for casino player card holders;
  unauthorized Members staying on Go Hilton Team Member or Family & Friends Travel Rates;

  contracted Entertainment or Encore rates;
  third party websites bookings (irrespective of rate paid); and
  "opaque" channel bookings where the brand may or may not be known at the time of purchase.
 
Hilton Honors Points (or stay credit) may not be earned (including as a My Way benefit) for or during ineligible stays, including without limitation, folio charges incurred during ineligible stays. Participating hotel will determine whether incidental charges incurred during either of those stays are eligible for Points.
No Points or credit toward tier status will be awarded for "no show" situations when a Member has made a reservation guaranteed with a credit card but then does not check in to the hotel--irrespective of whether or not the Member's credit card is charged for any portion of the reserved stay per the hotel's "no show" policy.
 A Member may earn Base Points for up to four rooms per stay ("Earning Rooms") if all eligible charges for Earning Rooms are paid on one folio. Base Points will be earned for all eligible folio charges incurred on Earning Rooms. The term "eligible folio charges" is defined below. Bonus Points issued on Base Points for tier bonuses (20%, 80% or 100%, depending on Member tier) will apply to the total Base Point credit earned for all Earning Rooms. For any other promotional bonuses, including double or triple point promotions, Hilton Honors Marketing Partner Bonus Points and other promotional bonuses (e.g. promotional miles), Bonus Points will be awarded on one room only. For purposes of obtaining tier status, a Member will receive stay and night credit for one room only. For the purposes of receiving Elite Member on-property benefits, a Member will receive these  benefits for themselves and one (1) guest only per stay regardless of the  number of rooms booked on the same reservation.
 "Double Points" means the Member will receive a bonus equal to the number of Base Points earned during a stay and "Triple Points" means the Member will receive a bonus double the number of Base Points earned during a stay. Bonus Points earned on Base Points do not count toward Elite tier qualification. These bonuses will only be awarded on one room only.
 Members will earn Hilton Honors Base Points for every eligible U.S. dollar (or other currency equivalent) charged to an individual Member's hotel bill ("eligible folio") for stays at participating hotels within the Hilton Portfolio.
 The term "eligible folio charges" within the Hilton Portfolio shall mean: room rate, food and beverage, telephone, laundry, pay-per-view movies, entertainment and recreational facilities, and other incidental charges charged to the Member's room during the Member's stay. Dining room or other charges not billed to a Member's room during a stay are not eligible for credit. Such hotels within the Hilton Portfolio may omit for purposes of Point accrual, incidental charges by non-affiliated hotel entities which are not owned and/or operated by the hotel including, but not limited to, food and beverage outlets, gift shop, drugstore, clothes, gallery or specialty stores, recreational or entertainment concessions.  Charges in connection with banquets or other catering functions are not considered "eligible folio charges" for purposes of Point accrual, with the exception of Points earned from qualifying meetings or events through the Hilton Honors Hilton Honors Event Planner Program. Folio charges incurred during an ineligible stay are not considered "eligible folio charges."
 Any applicable federal, state or local taxes, including, without limitation, city occupancy tax, are not considered "eligible folio charges" and will be omitted for purposes of Point accrual for hotel stays.
 There is no limit to the number of Base Points that Members may earn during a stay; however, Hilton Honors may review and adjust the amount of Base Points earned on any stay in order to ensure accuracy and compliance with these Terms and Conditions.
 Points awarded for stays at hotels within the Hilton Portfolio outside the U.S. will be based on local currency converted to U.S. dollars. Local currency will be converted into U.S. dollars weekly, using a published rate of exchange in effect at time of conversion. This rate will be determined at Hilton Honors' sole discretion, based on standard currency conversion methods but may vary from currency conversion rates used by credit card companies.
 A Member whose individual hotel bill is billed directly to a company and the Member is responsible for authorization for settlement at check-out is eligible for Hilton Honors Points as described herein. However, group master-billing arrangements where charges for multiple rooms are placed on one hotel bill and billed to a company or common address or settled at check-out by one individual are not eligible for Hilton Honors Points. Incidental charges (those charged to a Member's room) paid for directly by the Member at check-out are eligible for Point credit. Incidental charges billed to a master bill are not eligible for Point credit.
 Monthly activity statements are available via email or Members may access account information online.
 Members will not earn Points or promotional miles for hotel stays redeemed with a Marketing Partner's discount/free certificate (e.g. frequent flyer award or travel award), unless otherwise stated on the certificate. Members will not earn Points or promotional miles for incidental charges during hotel stays redeemed with a Marketing Partner's discount/free certificate unless otherwise stated on the certificate.
 Members will not earn promotional miles during a Reward Stay (even if there are incidental charges applied to the room during this type of stay).
 Members may earn Points for incidental charges at a hotel within the Hilton Portfolio during a full Points Reward Stay. Members may earn Points on the money portion of a Points & Money Rewards stay at all participating hotels within the Hilton Portfolio. For purposes of counting stays and nights for Elite tier qualification (as explained below) elite status gifting (as explained below) and milestone bonuses (as explained below), Reward Stays will count towards the number of overall stays and nights.
 Hilton Honors Points earned by any individual Member may be transferred only in accordance with the Points Transfer and Registry program or upon death as specified herein.
 Any Points offered in conjunction with specific hotel stays will be considered earned when the stay has been completed, fully paid and added to the Member's account. Points will not be available for redemption before the stay has been completed and paid and the Points have been added to the Member's account.
 If a Member believes he or she did not receive the correct Point credit(s) for hotel stays, he or she must submit a written request for such credit(s) to the nearest Hilton Reservations and Customer Care office, together with a legible copy of the Member's hotel folio. Failure to supply the adequate and unaltered documentation may result in denial of such Point credit. For the Member's protection, all hotel travel documentation should be retained by the Member until the Point credit has appeared on his or her Hilton Honors statement. Requests must be received at Hilton Reservations and Customer Care within six months from the date of activity. For new Members, credit will be accepted for any stay occurring within 30 days prior to enrollment in the Program. Written requests must also include the Member's name; Hilton Honors account number, address and daytime telephone number.

Elite Rollover Nights

 Members in all elite tiers (Silver, Gold and Diamond Members) are eligible to rollover any qualifying nights in excess of those required to qualify for their elite status level at the end of the calendar year (December 31st). 
 Members are only eligible to rollover qualifying nights in excess of those nights required to qualify for a member’s elite status level at the end of the calendar year (Members can rollover nights  in excess of 10 eligible nights for Silver, in excess of 40 eligible nights for Gold and in excess of 60 eligible nights for Diamond).
 Elite rollover nights will be counted toward members’ elite status qualification for the following calendar year (January 1st to December 31st). Base Members will not be eligible to rollover elite qualifying nights. Requirements for membership tiers can be viewed in the Hilton Honors Membership Tiers section. 
 Elite Rollover Nights are calculated as follows to apply to the next qualifying status year: Total qualifying nights at year end (inclusive of rollover from prior year)  any elite rollover nights from the previous year (now expired)  qualifying nights needed to renew your current elite status tier = elite rollover nights for next year
 Rollover nights are only valid for the next calendar year until December 31st and expire thereafter. Rollover nights cannot be reserved and applied to a second or third year. 
 Elite members can only rollover nights.  Stays or Base Points are not eligible to rollover to the following calendar year. 
 Elite members will rollover their elite qualifying nights even if they have downgraded status during the year.  The elite rollover nights will be a calculated in excess of the elite tier status level as of December 31 before applying the calculation. 
 Qualifying nights for paid and reward stays (including Points & Money Rewards stays) count as full qualifying nights for achieving status and are eligible to be rolled over to the following calendar year. Any elite qualifying nights earned through a promotional offer (i.e. double night credit) are also eligible and will be added to the total amount of rollover nights in excess of the number of nights required to gain elite tier status. 
Elite rollover nights will not count toward Milestone Bonuses and will only count toward a member achieving the next status tier.  Requirements for achieving the Milestone Bonuses can be viewed in the Milestone Bonuses section. 
 Elite rollover nights will not count toward Elite Status Gifting and will only count toward a member achieving the next status tier.  Requirements for being eligible for elite status gifting can be viewed in the Elite Status Gifting section. 

Elite Status Gifting

 Members who achieve 60 eligible nights within a calendar year will be able to gift Gold status to another member of their choice. If a member achieves 100 eligible nights within a calendar year then they will be able to gift Diamond status to a member of their choice. Once a member reaches 100 eligible nights, then the option to gift Gold is no longer available and will be changed to the ability to gift Diamond status. A member who reaches either of these night thresholds will only be able to gift status to one member for the calendar year. Once a member gifts Gold or Diamond, no additional gifting benefit will be available for that member in the same calendar year.
 Members who reach gifting qualifications by the end of the calendar year will be able to elect which member will receive that gift of status and must make that election by the following January. The member who is gifting the status must elect which other member will receive the gifted status by 11:59pm EST on January 31st of each calendar year. 
 The gifted status will start immediately after gifted and lasts 365 days from the date gifted. After 365 days, the gifted member’s status will change to the tier status that they would have earned without the gifted status in the previous calendar year. For a member who has gifted Gold status then reaches 100 nights, the gifted Gold upgrade will automatically upgrade to Diamond status and be valid for 365 days from the new upgrade date. Requirements for membership tiers can be viewed in Hilton Honors Membership Tiers section. 
 Members who qualify to gift status the following year can gift to the same member. Members will have to re-elect that specific member to gift the status each year, as the gift will not automatically carry over. 
 Once a status has been gifted to another member, no change can be made during the same year to remove or change that status. 
 The member who will be receiving the gifted status must be enrolled as a Hilton Honors member and this gift cannot be provided to someone who does not have a Hilton Honors account. 
 Qualifying nights for paid and reward stays (including Points & Money Rewards stays) count as full qualifying nights and are eligible toward achieving Gifting Status. Any elite qualifying nights earned through a promotional offer (i.e. double night credit) are also eligible and will be added to the total amount of eligible nights achieved to use Elite Gifting Status. Elite Rollover Nights do not count toward achieving Gifting Status. 

Reward Redemption

 To qualify for a Reward (a "Reward"), the Member must have sufficient Points in his or her account to redeem the Reward, with the following exception: at the time of redemption, a Member may purchase Hilton Honors Bonus Points to reach the required level for redemption (up to 80,000 per calendar year). See "Point Purchase" section for full Point Purchase Terms and Conditions.
 The pricing of reward nights flexes on factors such as the hotel, the level of daily demand, and the room rate. Prices are updated continuously and may change in real time.
 It is solely the responsibility of the Member to be informed about the Program and to request the specific Rewards online, via Hilton Reservations and Customer Care, by telephone or through the mobile app. Rewards requests placed by telephone will require the Member to provide account verification. Some Rewards may be available to print when redeeming online.
 When a Reward is requested, the corresponding number of Points will be deducted from the Member's account. When redeeming Points online, via phone or the mobile app for Hotel Reward Stays or exchanging Hilton Honors Points for airline miles through Reward Exchange, Points will be deducted from the Member's account automatically upon Member completing the redemption transaction.
 The Reward may be issued to the Hilton Honors Member, or to any other person, as directed by the Member. Once issued, the Reward is not transferable and may be used only by the individual named on the Reward. If a person other than the individual named on the Reward documentation attempts to redeem the Reward, the Reward will be deemed void and accommodations and/or transportation will be denied.
 A Reward Confirmation document redeemable for the Reward, requested by the Member, will be issued via the website when redeeming online, on the mobile app, or via Hilton Reservations and Customer Care.
 Rewards may not be sold, auctioned, bartered, brokered, purchased or otherwise transferred except with the express written consent of Hilton Honors. Any Reward obtained in that manner without the required consent will be considered to have been fraudulently obtained and deemed void. Altered Rewards are void. Voided Rewards will not be honored.
 All Rewards are subject to certain restrictions. See the Terms and Conditions below or online at Rewards which apply to each specific Reward.
 Marketing Partner Reward usage is subject to capacity controls, which limit the availability of rental cars, cruises, or the products offered by certain rental car companies or other Hilton Honors Marketing Partners, respectively.
 Travel Rewards are normally valid for one year from date of issuance though Hilton Honors may, from time to time, offer Rewards with shorter validity periods. Travel Reward validity periods appear on the face of the Reward.
 Rewards may not be combined with other certificates, discounts, packages or promotional offers unless otherwise specified in writing by Hilton Honors.
 Rewards cannot be redeemed for cash, prizes or credit.
 Points which have been deducted from the Member's account for a Reward may be re-deposited, in the discretion of Hilton Honors, only provided that ALL Reward documentation (including hotel, car and cruise Certificates) associated with the Reward are returned unused prior to the expiration date of the documentation. Rewards will be re-deposited only into the original account from which the Points were deducted.
 Promotional Rewards involving no Point deduction will not be extended beyond the validity date, exchanged or re-deposited into Member's account for Points or future use.
 Rewards are void where copied, prohibited or restricted by law.
 All Rewards must be redeemed in strict accordance with the procedures specified on the Reward Confirmation document.
 Hilton Honors Marketing Partner Rewards may be substituted with an equivalent Reward by Hilton Honors at any time without notice. Determination of Reward equivalency is at the sole discretion of Hilton Honors.
 Hotel Reward Stays apply to full Point redemptions or Point redemptions combined with money. Redemption stays can be used for Standard Rooms or Premium Rooms; both Reward types are for double occupancy room rate. Additional occupants, age 19 and above, are subject to the standard extra person charges. Any tax liability incurred (if any) in connection with the receipt and/or use of Hilton Honors Rewards, including, but not limited to, local or city occupancy taxes, international departure tax, customs fees, airport surcharges, non-resident tourism fees or individual income tax is the sole responsibility of the user. Incidental charges are the responsibility of the user. At hotels with resort fees, members on reward stays booked using all Points, or using a Promotional free night reward (e.g., issued by credit card partners, etc.) will not pay resort fees.
 Hilton Honors is not responsible, and assumes no liability for transportation or other services that Marketing Partners provide or fail to provide.
 Members residing in countries where redemption of Points for a Hilton Honors Reward, Partner Reward or Reward Exchange is prohibited are not eligible for such Reward.

Event Planner Program  Global

 Only the individual stipulated in the contract is eligible to receive    Event Planner Bonus Points on eligible charges associated with the event.    The individual that signs the contract does not need to be the individual    that receives the Event Planner Bonus Points. Event Planner Bonus Points    must be included in the event contract.
 The Event Planner Bonus Point recipient does not need to be a    registered guest or attend the meeting. The Event Planner Bonus Point    recipient must be a Member of Hilton Honors to receive Points in    connection with the event.
 The Hilton Honors Event Planner program is available to any Hilton    Honors member, including, but not limited to, individuals, professional    meeting and event planners, individuals booking events on behalf of their    employer (including B2B Pooled Accounts), tour operators, and travel    agents/travel sellers/conference planners that book a qualifying event. Hilton employees and/or hotel team members are not eligible to accrue Points when contracting business on behalf of Hilton at any property within the Hilton portfolio.
 Members will earn 1 Hilton Honors Bonus Point per $1 USD spent on    eligible charges for qualifying events. Points awarded will be based on    local currency converted to U.S. dollars. Local currency will be converted    to U.S. dollars on the day final payment is received for the event using a    published rate of exchange in effect at time of conversion. This rate will    be determined at Hilton Honors' sole discretion, based on standard    currency conversion methods.
 A qualifying event may include, but is not limited to, a group or    business meeting, conference, room block, wedding reception, family    reunion or other event contracted through the sales or catering department    and sold at published rates.

Event Planner Bonus Points must be awarded for meeting    room and guest room charges; eligibility of all other charges is at the    sole discretion of the hotel. In the case where room rental/room hire is    included as part of a per person meeting package, awarding points on a    portion of the package is at the discretion of the hotel.
 If guest rooms are included in the contract, Members who reserve and    pay for rooms under their own account are also eligible to earn Points for    stays in accordance with Hilton Honors Terms and Conditions. If guest rooms    are included in the contract and charged to a master bill (where charges    for multiple rooms are placed on one hotel bill and billed to a company or    common address or settled at check-out by one individual), Members are not    eligible to earn Points. Incidental charges (those charged to a Member's    room) paid for directly by the Member at check-out are eligible for Point    credit. Incidental charges billed to a master bill are not eligible for Point credit.
 Event Planner Bonus Points can be awarded on charges up to $100,000    USD. There is no maximum on the number of Points that can be awarded per    event.
 Please allow 6-8 weeks after the event has been paid for in full, for    posting of Points to Member's account.
 The Hilton Honors Event Planner program is available globally at    participating hotels in the Hilton portfolio. Participating hotels are    listed at www.hiltonhonors.com/eventplanner. If a Member requests Hilton Honors Event Planner Points from one of    these hotels for a qualifying event, the hotel must award them.
 No Hilton Honors Points will be awarded for "no show" or    cancelled events when a Member has booked an event guaranteed with a    credit card but then does not hold the event--irrespective of whether or    not the Member's credit card is charged for any portion of the event per    the hotel's "no show" or cancellation policy.
 Hilton Honors Event Credits are vouchers that can be obtained by    redeeming Hilton Honors Points, and can be used as a credit against future    bookings. Event Credit vouchers may be redeemed at any hotel in the Hilton    Portfolio, even if the hotel is not an Event Planner program participating    hotel. Event Credit vouchers are available in the following increments:
25,000 Points = $50 USD
 50,000 Points = $100 USD
 75,000 Points = $150 USD
 125,000 Points = $250 USD
 250,000 Points = $500 USD
 
  Members can redeem Points for Event Credits by    calling the nearest Hilton Reservations and Customer Care office. The Event Credit voucher for the    corresponding amount will then be sent to the Member via email. The    Member will then present the voucher to the hotel at time of payment to    receive the corresponding discount (US $50, $100, $150, $250 or $500).
  For currencies other than US Dollars, conversion    will be based on the prevailing month-end exchange rate on the day the    final bill is created for the event. Conversion rates can be obtained    from the hotel’s finance department.
  Multiple vouchers may be redeemed at the same time.
  Vouchers will expire one year from the date of    issuance.
  If the total bill is less than the value of the    Event Credits, Member will forfeit any remaining value.
 
 Hilton Honors membership, earning of Points, and redemption of Points    are subject to Hilton Honors Terms and Conditions. Event Planner earnings    are void where prohibited or restricted by local law.

Conditions of Participation
 HILTON HONORS PROVIDES THE HILTON HONORS PROGRAM, THESE AND OTHER MATERIALS, AND OTHER SERVICES AND PRODUCTS "AS-IS" AND, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, DESIGN, ACCURACY, CAPABILITY, SUFFICIENCY, SUITABILITY, CAPACITY, COMPLETENESS OR AVAILABILITY. You also agree that Hilton Honors does not represent, warrant or guaranty that the Hilton Honors Program or any such other products and services will be uninterrupted, without omissions or error free, or that defects will be corrected or changes implemented. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE, SHALL HILTON BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE HILTON HONORS PROGRAM OR ANY SUCH OTHER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, EVEN IF A HILTON HONORS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, therefore such exclusions may not apply to you. In the event Hilton Honors is held liable for any damages related to such matters, your sole and exclusive remedy will be limited to reimbursement for services or products paid by you to the entity held liable which were not provided by such entity. You hereby waive any and all rights to bring any claim or action related to such matters in any forum beyond two (2) years after the first occurrence of the kind of act, event, condition or omission upon which the claim or action is based. If any provision(s) of these Official Rules are held to be invalid or unenforceable, all remaining provisions hereof will remain in full force and effect. The failure by Hilton Honors to exercise rights granted to Hilton Honors hereunder upon the occurrence of any of the contingencies set forth in this agreement will not constitute a waiver of such rights upon the recurrence of such contingency.
