How Secured Credit Cards Work
 


To fund your U.S. Bank Secured Visa Card, you can choose to:

Fund online using your checking or savings account.
Print an application and mail a cashier’s check or money order. Personal checks are not allowed.

If your application is approved, we'll send you a credit card with a credit line the same amount as your deposit.

The deposit is used to open a U.S. Bank secured savings account to ensure your card can be paid. The U.S. Bank secured savings account is FDIC-insured, earns interest and won't be touched as long as your account remains open and in good standing.
Purchases with the U.S. Bank Secured Visa Card are billed to you each month as with any credit card.
Payments are not automatically deducted from your secured savings account. You're responsible for making at least your minimum payment by the monthly due date.
