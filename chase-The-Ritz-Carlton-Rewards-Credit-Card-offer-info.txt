s Categories: Merchants who accept Visa/MasterCard credit cards are assigned a m
erchant code, which is determined by the merchant or its processor in accordance
 with Visa/MasterCard procedures based on the kinds of products and services the
y primarily sell. We group similar merchant codes into categories for purposes o
f making rewards offers to you. Please note: We make every effort to include all
 relevant merchant codes in our rewards categories. However, even though a merch
ant or some of the items that it sells may appear to fit within a rewards catego
ry, the merchant may not have a merchant code in that category. When this occurs
, purchases with that merchant won't qualify for rewards offers on purchases in 
that category. Purchases submitted by you, an authorized user, or the merchant t
hrough third-party payment accounts, mobile or wireless card readers, online or 
mobile digital wallets, or similar technology will not qualify in a rewards cate
gory if the technology is not set up to process the purchase in that rewards cat
egory. For more information about Chase rewards categories, see www.Chase.com/Re
