		about your Card Account behavior, like delinquencies, to consumer reporting agencies.

Special Notices

            
                Notice to Ohio Residents: The Ohio laws against discrimination require that all creditors make credit equally available to all 
                creditworthy customers, and that credit reporting agencies maintain separate credit histories on each individual upon request. 
                The Ohio Civil Rights Commission administers compliance with this law.
            

            
                Notice to Wisconsin Residents: No marital property agreement, unilateral statement, or court decree adversely affects our rights, unless you give us a copy of such agreement, statement or court order before we grant you credit, or we have actual knowledge of its terms before your account is opened.

                You're responsible for all charges made or allowed to the Card Account by the authorized user.
                Authorized users have access to your Card Account information.

Balance Transfer Information

            
                How to Make Balance Transfers
            

            
                
                   After receiving your card, you can call the customer service number on the back of your card to transfer balances. Balance transfers are made available at our discretion. All balance transfers are subject to the standard purchase APR unless an introductory and/or other promotional rate applies.
                
                
                    If we give you the option to transfer a balance with your application, it will take at least 14 days after your Card Account is opened to process any balance transfer payments. During this time, you may cancel or modify your balance transfer request by calling the number on the back of your card.
                
                
                    You may transfer any amount, but the total amount of your balance transfer plus balance transfer fees must be less than your available credit limit. Be sure you don't transfer any disputed purchase or other charge amount because you may lose your dispute rights. You cannot transfer balances from other accounts issued by Citi or its affiliates. If you are unsure of the issuer on the account, please visit www.citi.com/affiliatesproducts for a list of Citi products and affiliates.
Continue to make payments on your other accounts until you have confirmed this balance transfer has been received. Once approved, we'll pay the amount of the balance transfer directly to that issuer. The available credit limit for your new card will be reduced by the total amount of the transfers, including fees we approve.
            

            Things You Should Know About Your Balance Transfer Offer:

   If you transfer a balance with this offer, interest will be charged on purchases made with your credit card unless your purchases have a 0% APR or you pay the New Balance shown on your statement (including the amount of your balance transfer) in full by the payment due date each billing period.
If you default under your Card Agreement you may lose any promotional APR on the balance transfer.

 
Additional Information


    Any benefit, reward, service or feature offered in connection with your Card Account may change or be discontinued at any time for any reason, except as otherwise expressly indicated. Citi isn't responsible for products and services offered by other companies.




Citi® Double Cash Card Reward Program Information
• Your Card Account will earn cash rewards based on your eligible transactions. Such eligible transactions include purchases and payments made based on those purchases. The cash rewards will show cumulatively on your billing statement as "cash back on purchases" and "cash back on payments".
• Cash Back on Purchases: Unless you are participating in a limited time promotional offer, you will earn 1% cash back based upon eligible purchases appearing on your current month's billing statement. Eligible purchases you make will be accumulated in the "Purchase Tracker" shown on your billing statement. The Purchase Tracker shows the balance eligible to earn cash back on payments each billing cycle. Eligible purchases do not include balance transfers, cash advances, convenience checks, disputed or unauthorized purchases/fraudulent transactions, Card Account fees and finance charges and fees for services or programs you elect to receive through us. Limited time promotional offers do not apply to personal banking transactions you make so you will only earn 1% on these transactions.
• Cash Back on Payments: You will also earn 1% cash back on payments you make that appear on your current month's billing statement as long as the amount paid is at least the Minimum Payment Due that is printed on your billing statement and there is a balance in the Purchase Tracker. The balance in the Purchase Tracker is reduced by eligible payments you make. When the Purchase Tracker reaches $0, you won't earn cash back on payments until more eligible purchases are made.
• Redeeming Cash Rewards: As soon as the cash rewards balance totals $25 or more, you may visit www.citi.com or contact us at 1-855-473-4583 to redeem your cash rewards. You can choose to redeem your cash rewards as follows:

    Request a check for at least $25 up to the total cash rewards balance at the time you redeem;
    Redeem for a statement credit to your Card Account for at least $25 up to the total cash rewards balance at the time you redeem;
    Redeem for a credit to your linked Citi savings or checking account or to a checking account from which you have paid a Citi Credit Card bill at least two times.

  
Only you may redeem cash rewards, unless you or we agree otherwise. You are responsible for any taxes that may be due on cash rewards redemptions.
• Account Closure: If we close your Card Account, you will no longer be able to earn or redeem your cash rewards, and you will forfeit any accumulated cash rewards. If you close or convert your Card Account, you will no longer be able to earn cash rewards and you must redeem any eligible cash rewards prior to account closure or cash rewards will be forfeited.
• Cash Rewards Expiration: Your cash rewards balance will expire if you have not earned any cash back from purchases or payments for 12 months.
• Value of Cash Rewards: Cash rewards have no cash value until such time as you may request and receive redemption (check or statement credit) for your eligible cash rewards. You may not assign, transfer, or pledge your cash rewards. You have no property rights or other legal interest in cash rewards.
• Program Rules: We may revise any of these terms at any time with 30 days prior written notice. In addition, we may terminate the Citi Double Cash Card Reward Program with 30 days prior written notice. If we terminate the program, you will only have 90 days to request your redemption eligible cash rewards.
• Fraud: If your Card Account shows any sign of fraudulent, abusive or suspicious activity, we may close or suspend your Card Account immediately without giving you prior notice. You may also forfeit your accrued cash rewards.
• When you become a cardmember, you will receive the full Citi® Double Cash Card Terms and Conditions.
