e enter the 15/16 digit account number from the Mastercard, Visa, American Expre
ss, or Discover Card account that you want us to process a balance transfer from
. If the total amount you request exceeds the assigned credit line on your new a
ccount, we may either decline the request or send a partial payment to your cred
itor(s). The amount of available credit on your new account will be reduced by t
he amount transferred and the related balance transfer fees. We reserve the righ
t to decline to process any requested balance transfer. We will not process a re
quest to transfer a balance from any other account you may have with us. Balance
 transfers incur interest from the transaction date. You should not transfer the
 amount of any disputed purchase or other charge. If you do, you may lose your d
ispute rights.Upon approval of your application we will process the requested ba
lance transfer payment to the account(s) which you have requested on the 10th da
y after we've mailed you your card; during this 10 day time period you may cance
l your balance transfer by contacting us at the number on the back of your card.

 as a credit. If you would like to complete a balance transfer from another acco
unt that is not a Visa, Mastercard, American Express or Discover Card account, p

roved. Balance transfers are subject to availability. We may deny balance transf
er requests at any time and for any reason.Avoiding Interest on Purchases: We wi
ll not charge you interest on any purchases if you pay your entire balance by th
e due date each month. In addition, during this introductory period we will not 
charge you interest on purchases if you pay by the due date each month your outs
tanding statement balance minus any new 0% introductory APR Balance Transfer bal
ances. To avoid a late fee, you should pay at least the minimum payment due on y
our account each month.Credit Limit: We do not permit applicants to request a sp
ecific credit limit. We do not consider a request for a balance transfer made wi
th an application to be a request for a particular credit limit. We determine th
e credit limit on your account independent of and prior to processing any balanc
e transfer request.Cash Equivalent Purchases: The purchase of money orders, trav
elers' checks, foreign currency, lottery tickets, gambling chips, wire transfers
 and other similar transactions are treated as cash advances. Please see your Ca
