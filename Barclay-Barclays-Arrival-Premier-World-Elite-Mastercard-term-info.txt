r Opening a New Account: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism a
nd money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions 
to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens 
an account. What this means to you: When you apply for an account, we will ask f
or your name, street address, date of birth, social security number, and other i
nformation that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see copies of 
identifying documents. We also ask for country of citizenship.Balance Transfers.
 Here's How it Works: To request a balance transfer please enter the 15/16 digit
 account number from the Mastercard, Visa, American Express, or Discover Card ac
count that you want us to process a balance transfer from. If the total amount y
ou request exceeds the assigned credit line on your new account, we may either d
ecline the request or send a partial payment to your creditor(s). The amount of 
available credit on your new account will be reduced by the amount transferred a
nd the related balance transfer fees. We reserve the right to decline to process
 any requested balance transfer. We will not process a request to transfer a bal
ance from any other account you may have with us. Balance transfers incur intere
st from the transaction date. You should not transfer the amount of any disputed
 purchase or other charge. If you do, you may lose your dispute rights. Upon app
roval of your application we will process the requested balance transfer payment
 to the account(s) which you have requested on the 10th day after we've mailed y
ou your card; during this 10 day time period you may cancel your balance transfe
r by contacting us at the number on the back of your card. A balance transfer ma
y take up to 4 weeks to post to your other accounts. Continue to pay each credit
or until the balance transfer appears on the other account as a credit. If you w
ould like to complete a balance transfer from another account that is not a Visa
, Mastercard, American Express or Discover Card account, please call the phone n
umber on the back of your new credit card once you are approved. Balance transfe
rs are subject to availability. We may deny balance transfer requests at any tim
e and for any reason.Credit Limit: We do not permit applicants to request a spec
ific credit limit. We do not consider a request for a balance transfer made with
 an application to be a request for a particular credit limit. We determine the 
credit limit on your account independent of and prior to processing any balance 
transfer request.Cash Equivalent Purchases: The purchase of money orders, travel
ers' checks, foreign currency, lottery tickets, gambling chips, wire transfers a
nd other similar transactions are treated as cash advances. Please see your Card
member Agreement for details.New York Residents: New York residents may contact 
the New York State Department of Financial Services by telephone (800) 342-3736,
 or visit the website, www.dfs.ny.gov, for free information on comparative credi
t card rates, fees and grace periods. Notice to Ohio Residents: The Ohio laws ag

e credit histories on each individual upon request.  The Ohio Civil Rights Commi
ssion administers compliance with this law.Notice to Married Wisconsin Residents
