If you link your Bank of America deposit account to your credit card for Overdraft Protection, we will automatically transfer funds in multiples of $100 from your credit card account to cover any overdraft on your deposit account, as long as the portion of credit available for cash on your credit card account is sufficient and you are not in default under your Credit Card Agreement. A fee of $12 will apply for each transaction.
