I make my payments on time, usually over minimum payment, yet my minimum payment goes up considerable when I don't "max" out my card for the month. When I call, customer service reads from a script and tells me it the variable interest rate. I have variable interest rates on all my cards, and they NEVER increase my minimum payment more than $50 when my balance goes DOWN. It seems I'm being penalized for not using the card because I'm trying to pay it off. It may not seem like a lot of money to some people, but $50 to a teacher is A LOT of money a month and really messes up my budget.More DetailsWhich benefit do you enjoy the most?No Annual FeesCustomer Service1Rated 1 out of 5 starsOnline Account Access3Rated 3 out of 5 starsBottom Line No, I would not recommend to a friendWas this review helpful to you?00Flag this review5Citi Has Me in the Long RunRated 5 out of 5 starsSubmitted  1 year ago By GJ From Clearwater, FLVerified BuyerVerified BuyerVerified BuyerMy Citi cards are the longest term ones I have and am still pleased with.More DetailsWhich benefit do you enjoy the most?24/7 Personalized Concierge Service, Customer service people seem genuinely intereste, No Annual FeesCustomer Service5Rated 5 out of 5 starsOnline Account Access5Rated 5 out of 5 starsBottom Line Yes, I would recommend to a friendWas this review helpful to you?00Flag this review5Meets my needsRated 5 out of 5 starsSubmitted  1 year ago By KathyW From PennsylvaniaVerified BuyerVerified BuyerVerified BuyerI've had a Citi card for years & it had continuously met my needs.
