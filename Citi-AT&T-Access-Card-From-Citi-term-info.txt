 if the code matches a category that gives you additional points, you will earn 
the additional points. Because we don't control what code a merchant is assigned
, sometimes a purchase that you think fits a certain category may not earn addit
ional points. For example, a restaurant located within a large retail outlet may
 not be assigned a "restaurant" code, but rather a "retailer" code. This means t
hat if you receive additional points for "dining out," you won't earn additional
 points for purchases at that restaurant. Or a restaurant located within a hotel
 may not be assigned a "restaurant" code, but rather a "hotel" code. This means 
that if you receive more points for purchases at a hotel than you receive for pu
rchases at a restaurant, each purchase at that restaurant will be treated as a p
urchase at a hotel, and you'll receive additional Points. Please see our FAQs at
