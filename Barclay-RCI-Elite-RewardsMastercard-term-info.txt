dering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, ve
rify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. W
hat this means to you: When you apply for an account, we will ask for your name,
 street address, date of birth, social security number, and other information th
at will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see copies of identifying d
ocuments. We also ask for country of citizenship.Balance Transfers. Here's How i
t Works: To request a balance transfer please enter the 15/16 digit account numb
er from the Mastercard, Visa, American Express, or Discover Card account that yo
u want us to process a balance transfer from. If the total amount you request ex
ceeds the assigned credit line on your new account, we may either decline the re
quest or send a partial payment to your creditor(s). The amount of available cre
dit on your new account will be reduced by the amount transferred and the relate
d balance transfer fees. We reserve the right to decline to process any requeste
d balance transfer. We will not process a request to transfer a balance from any
 other account you may have with us. Balance transfers incur interest from the t
ransaction date. You should not transfer the amount of any disputed purchase or 
other charge. If you do, you may lose your dispute rights.Upon approval of your 
application we will process the requested balance transfer payment to the accoun
t(s) which you have requested on the 10th day after we've mailed you your card; 
during this 10 day time period you may cancel your balance transfer by contactin
g us at the number on the back of your card. A balance transfer may take up to 4
 weeks to post to your other accounts. Continue to pay each creditor until the b
alance transfer appears on the other account as a credit. If you would like to c
omplete a balance transfer from another account that is not a Visa, Mastercard, 
American Express or Discover Card account, please call the phone number on the b
ack of your new credit card once you are approved. Balance transfers are subject
 to availability. We may deny balance transfer requests at any time and for any 
reason.Avoiding Interest on Purchases: We will not charge you interest on any pu
rchases if you pay your entire balance by the due date each month. In addition, 
during this introductory period we will not charge you interest on purchases if 
you pay by the due date each month your outstanding statement balance minus any 
new 0% introductory APR Balance Transfer balances. To avoid a late fee, you shou
ld pay at least the minimum payment due on your account each month.Credit Limit:
 We do not permit applicants to request a specific credit limit. We do not consi
der a request for a balance transfer made with an application to be a request fo
r a particular credit limit. We determine the credit limit on your account indep
endent of and prior to processing any balance transfer request.Cash Equivalent P
urchases: The purchase of money orders, travelers' checks, foreign currency, lot
tery tickets, gambling chips, wire transfers and other similar transactions are 
treated as cash advances. Please see your Cardmember Agreement for details.New Y
