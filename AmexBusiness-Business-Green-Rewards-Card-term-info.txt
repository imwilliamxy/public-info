Eligible purchases do NOT include fees or interest charges, balance transfers, cash advances, purchases of travelers checks, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, Purchases of gift cards; person-to-person payments, or purchases of other cash equivalents. Product features vary. Not all of the foregoing transactions are available on every product that may be used to meet the Spending Requirement.  We use the date of purchase to determine whether a purchase was made during the Previous Year. A date of purchase may sometimes be different from the date on which you made the transaction. For example, if you buy goods online, the purchase date may be the date the goods are shipped. Also, if you use your Card while traveling (such as on a hotel or car rental), the purchase date may be the date you complete that travel. The foregoing are the “Eligibility Requirements”.Selection At the beginning of each calendar year, American Express will (1) determine which businesses met the Eligibility Requirements in the Previous Year, and, from that group, (2) identify the businesses that American Express, in its sole discretion, considers to be part of its middle market customer segment in the U.S. (“Eligible Middle Market Customers”). All Eligible Middle Market Customers will be included in the Program for the next Program Year, or until their participation in the Program is terminated in accordance with these Program Terms.  Termination of Tier One Status A business’s participation in the Program will automatically terminate upon the termination of its last American Express U.S. Business Charge Card or Corporate Card account, or at the end of the Program Year if the business is not selected for the Program for the following Program Year in accordance with these Program Terms. American Express may, in its sole discretion, terminate a business’s participation in the Program by written notice during the Program Year. American Express will have no further liability or obligation under the Program upon termination of a business’s participation in the Program. Participation in the Program, will not affect American Express’s maintenance of all Card accounts in accordance with its consistently applied risk policies and practices, including but not limited to underwriting decisions such as increasing or reducing spend capacity or lines of credit, and terminating accounts.  Interpretation Decisions of American Express with respect to the interpretation and application of these Program Terms – including decisions about a business’s eligibility for the Program – will be made by American Express in its sole discretion.

MODIFICATION & CANCELLATION OF THE PROGRAM American Express reserves the right to modify or cancel the Program at any time at its discretion without prior notice or liability to you.Upgrade with Points Terms and ConditionsWhen you use Upgrade with Points to request an airline ticket upgrade, three things will happen: (i) If the airline upgrades your ticket(s), your Card Account will be charged for the upgrade; (ii) American Express will deduct the Membership Rewards points you offered for the upgrade from your program account; and (iii) American Express will apply an accompanying credit to your Card Account for those points. If the airline upgrades your ticket(s) and the number of points available in your Membership Rewards program account is less than the number of points you originally offered, American Express will deduct only the number of points available and you will receive an accompanying credit only for that number of points. The credit to your Card Account may appear during a different billing cycle than the charge for upgrade. You are still responsible for paying the amount due on your Card statement by the due date. Any applicable taxes and fees in connection with an airline ticket upgrade will be charged to your Card Account and cannot be covered with points. The value of the points you offer is determined at the time your upgrade offer is accepted by the airline and may change after your upgrade offer has been submitted if you subsequently upgrade or downgrade your Card Account. Once accepted by the airline, your upgrade offer is nonrefundable, non-changeable, and points cannot be returned to your Membership Rewards program account.  Each airline determines whether to accept upgrade offers and which upgrade offers it will accept based on factors it determines in its discretion, including the amount of an offer. While it is possible for airlines to accept an upgrade offer at any time after offer submission, most upgrades are processed between 5 and 1 days before departure, and some are processed as close as 1 hour before departure. If your flight reservation includes tickets for more than one passenger, the tickets for all passengers on the reservation will be upgraded if your upgrade offer is accepted by the airline. If you would like to upgrade only certain passengers, you must contact the airline to split your reservation prior to requesting an upgrade. If your Card offers additional points for flights purchased directly from an airline, you will not receive additional points for your upgrade purchase. Participating airlines’ Terms & Conditions apply. Participating airlines are subject to change at any time without notice. Participating airline products and services are subject to change. American Express reserves the right to cancel any upgrade offers or discontinue the Upgrade with Points program at any time.  If you use a Pay Over Time feature for a purchase using Upgrade with Points, the statement credit you receive may not be applied to that feature. Instead, it might be applied to your Pay in Full balance. If you think this has happened, please call us using the number on the back of your Card.Using Points for ChargesUsing Points for Your Charges is only available to Basic Consumer and OPEN Card Members enrolled in the U.S. Membership Rewards® program.
