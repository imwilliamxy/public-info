I make my payments on time, usually over minimum payment, yet my minimum payment goes up considerable when I don't "max" out my card for the month. When I call, customer service reads from a script and tells me it the variable interest rate. I have variable interest rates on all my cards, and they NEVER increase my minimum payment more than $50 when my balance goes DOWN. It seems I'm being penalized for not using the card because I'm trying to pay it off. It may not seem like a lot of money to some people, but $50 to a teacher is A LOT of money a month and really messes up my budget.More DetailsWhich benefit do you enjoy the most?No Annual FeesCustomer Service1Rated 1 out of 5 starsOnline Account Access3Rated 3 out of 5 starsBottom Line No, I would not recommend to a friend Was this review helpful to you?00Flag this review5Rated 5 out of 5 starsCiti Has Me in the Long RunSubmitted  3 months ago                                              By                                            GJ                                                              From                                        Clearwater, FL                  Verified BuyerVerified BuyerVerified BuyerMy Citi cards are the longest term ones I have and am still pleased with.More DetailsWhich benefit do you enjoy the most?247 Personalized Concierge Service, Customer service people seem genuinely intereste, No Annual FeesCustomer Service5Rated 5 out of 5 starsOnline Account Access5Rated 5 out of 5 starsBottom Line Yes, I would recommend to a friend Was this review helpful to you?00Flag this review5Rated 5 out of 5 starsMeets my needsSubmitted  4 months ago                                              By                                            KathyW                                                              From                                        Pennsylvania                  Verified BuyerVerified BuyerVerified BuyerI've had a Citi card for years & it had continuously met my needs.

Thought it was great until I lost my job and couldn't pay off 2 cards at once.   Have deal with them to pay off one at a low amount, so they are raising the minimum on the remaining card to get more out of me.  Will never return to Citi again.More DetailsCustomer Service1Rated 1 out of 5 starsOnline Account Access3Rated 3 out of 5 starsBottom Line No, I would not recommend to a friend Was this review helpful to you?00Flag this review5Rated 5 out of 5 starssmartshopSubmitted  4 months ago                                              By                                            smartshop                                                              From                                        Stuart, FL                  Verified BuyerVerified BuyerVerified BuyerI have relied on this card for large purchases as well as convenience for smaller purchases without having to worry having any problems..More DetailsWhich benefit do you enjoy the most?247 Personalized Concierge Service, Citi Price Rewind, FICO Score, Fraud Alert protection, No Annual FeesCustomer Service5Rated 5 out of 5 starsOnline Account Access5Rated 5 out of 5 starsBottom Line Yes, I would recommend to a friend Was this review helpful to you?00Flag this review5Rated 5 out of 5 starsBlack MumbaSubmitted  4 months ago                                              By                                            Black Mumba                                                              From                                        Bronx NY                  Verified BuyerVerified BuyerVerified BuyerOutstanding all around satisfactionMore DetailsWhich benefit do you enjoy the most?Citi Price Rewind, No Annual FeesCustomer Service5Rated 5 out of 5 starsOnline Account Access1Rated 1 out of 5 stars Was this review helpful to you?00Flag this review4Rated 4 out of 5 starsGreat credit card with Black color !Submitted  4 months ago                                              By                                            Payam                                                              From                                        San Diego                  Verified BuyerVerified BuyerVerified BuyerI wish it had rewards points too.I like the color of card " black "More DetailsWhich benefit do you enjoy the most?247 Personalized Concierge Service, Citi Price Rewind, No Annual FeesCustomer Service4Rated 4 out of 5 starsOnline Account Access4Rated 4 out of 5 starsBottom Line Yes, I would recommend to a friend Was this review helpful to you?00Flag this reviewDisplaying Reviews 1-10Back to TopNext »    Citi does not guarantee the accuracy of these reviews.
