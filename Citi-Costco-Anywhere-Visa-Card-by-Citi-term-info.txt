 to Make Balance Transfers

   Certain Non-Qualifying Purchases. You will only earn 1%, not 3%, for purchase
s made at bakeries and certain restaurants/cafes inside department stores, groce

              2% cash back on all other purchases from Costco and Costco.com.

                  Merchant Classification: Each merchant - that is a retailer, b
usiness or any other place where you can make a purchase - is assigned a code th
at indicates the merchant's area of business. For example, restaurants are gener
ally assigned a specific merchant code. We don't assign or have any control over
 merchant codes. Codes are chosen and assigned by a third party, who may change 
the codes from time to time. When you make a purchase at a merchant, we're provi
ded the code for that merchant. If the code matches a category that gives you ad
ditional Costco Cash Rewards - for example, if the merchant code tells us that y
ou made a purchase at a restaurant - we'll give you the additional Costco Cash R
ewards for that purchase. Because we don't control what code a merchant is assig
ned, sometimes a purchase that you think fits a certain category may not earn ad
ditional Costco Cash Rewards. For example, a restaurant located within a large r
etail outlet may not be assigned a "restaurant" code, but rather a "retailer" co
de. This means that even though you receive additional Costco Cash Rewards for p
urchases at "restaurants," you won't earn additional Costco Cash Rewards for pur
chases at that restaurant.            What doesn't qualify as a purchase?: The f
ollowing types of transactions don't qualify as purchases that earn Costco Cash 
Rewards:                            Use of checks that access your Card Account 
               Balance transfers                Cash advances                   
                 Travelers checks, foreign currency purchases, money orders, wir
e transfers and similar cash-like transactions                                Lo
ttery tickets, gaming chips and similar betting transactions                Inte
rest and account fees                Unauthorized charges                Items r
eturned for credit                        Returns: Returned items may result in 
credits being applied to your Card Account which will reduce or may eliminate ac
cumulated Costco Cash Rewards and may result in a negative cash rewards balance.
 If your Card Account has a negative Costco Cash Rewards balance, any newly earn
ed Costco Cash Rewards will be used to offset such negative Costco Cash Rewards 
balance until such balance has been brought to zero.            You must maintai
n your Costco Membership to receive and redeem your Costco Cash Rewards.        
    Redeeming Costco Cash Rewards: Your reward is distributed annually, in the f
orm of a credit card reward certificate, once your February billing statement cl
oses, and is redeemable through December 31 of the year issued in a single trans
action at any U.S. Costco warehouse, including in Puerto Rico, for merchandise o
r cash back. The credit card reward certificate will contain your Costco Cash Re
wards balance based on your eligible purchases during the annual reward period. 
The annual reward period is based on January through December billing statements
. Should you choose to redeem only a portion of the certificate for merchandise,
 you will receive the remaining balance in cash at the Costco warehouse register
 upon checkout. Some warehouses may not permit the credit card reward certificat
e to be redeemed for alcohol purchases. Requests for cash may be fulfilled in th
e form of a check at  Costco's  discretion. Your credit card reward certificate 
must be redeemed in person on or prior to its expiration date of December 31 in 
the year in which it is issued. Any Costco Cash Rewards you have earned on purch
ases made by authorized users on your Card Account will be added to your Costco 
Cash Rewards total. Only you, the primary cardmember, are eligible to receive th
e annual credit card reward certificate; however, you or anyone you authorize ma
y redeem the certificate. You will not receive a credit card reward certificate 
if your reward is less than $1 or your account is closed at the time your credit
 card reward certificate is scheduled to be sent; any Costco Cash Rewards that h
ad been accrued at that time will be forfeited. You must maintain your Costco Me
mbership to redeem your credit card reward certificate.            Account Closu
re: If we close your Card Account, you will no longer be able to earn Costco Cas
h Rewards, and you will forfeit any Costco Cash Rewards accumulated, but not yet
 distributed. If you close or convert your Card Account prior to receiving the c
redit card reward certificate in your February billing statement, any earned Cos
tco Cash Rewards will be forfeited.            Forfeiture: All Costco Cash Rewar
ds not disbursed via an annual credit card reward certificate due to the reward 
amount being less than $1, the account status (including account closure), or ot
her reasons, will be forfeited. Additionally, any Costco Cash Rewards not redeem
ed by December 31 of the year of issuance of the credit card reward certificate 
will be forfeited.            Value of Costco Cash Rewards: Costco Cash Rewards 
have no cash value until such time as they are redeemed at a Costco warehouse.  
          Property Rights: You have no property rights or other legal interests 
in Costco Cash Rewards. Costco Cash Rewards may not be transferred to any other 
person including through such events as inheritance, bankruptcy or divorce. Cost
co Cash Rewards cannot be assigned or pledged.            Changes to Program Rul
es: We may make changes to the Costco Cash Rewards Program at any time without n

h Rewards, a change that negatively affects how you can exercise your rights wit
