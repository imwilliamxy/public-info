                        All correspondence, including credit cards, statements, and notifications will be sent to the name and address on file for the primary cardmember. The primary cardmember is responsible for repaying all balances on this account. Authorized users will have the same account number and charging privileges as the primary cardmember but will not be financially responsible. Chase provides account information to the credit reporting agencies for all account users. This information could impact an authorized user's credit score. When you tell us to add a user to your account, you're confirming that you have a relationship with the person or people whose name(s), address(es), and date of birth(s) you've told us, that all their information is correct, and that you have their consent to add them. If Chase determines you've given us fraudulent name, address, or date of birth information, or did not have such consent, Chase can close this account.

                        Rewards Program Agreement: For more information about the Hyatt® Credit Card rewards program, view the latest Rewards Program Agreement. We will mail your Rewards Program Agreement once your account is established. If you become a Chase Online customer, your Rewards Program Agreement will also be available after logging in to chase.com.
        How you can earn Rewards Points: You'll earn World of Hyatt Bonus Points when you, or an authorized user, use a Hyatt® Credit Card to make purchases of products and services, minus returns or refunds. Buying products and services with your card, in most cases, will count as a purchase; however, the following types of transactions won't count as a purchase and won't earn World of Hyatt Bonus Points: balance transfers, cash advances and other cash-like transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting transactions, any checks that access your account, interest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if applicable. 3 Bonus Points: You'll earn 3 World of Hyatt Bonus Points for each $1 USD spent on purchases made at Hyatt hotels and resorts (including at participating restaurants and participating locations that are owned, managed, franchised or licensed by Hyatt Corporation or its subsidiaries or affiliates). 2 Bonus Points: You'll earn 2 World of Hyatt Bonus Points for each $1 USD spent on purchases made in any of the following categories: restaurants (excluding dining purchases that qualify for 3 Bonus Points as described above); airline tickets when purchased directly from the airline; and car rental agencies. 1 Bonus Point: You'll earn 1 World of Hyatt Bonus Point for each $1 spent on all other purchases. Information about earning/transferring Bonus Points to Hyatt: You must be a World of Hyatt member to receive and use Bonus Points, Free Night Awards, or other World of Hyatt program benefits. If you are currently a World of Hyatt member, Bonus Points you earn through your Hyatt Credit Card will be deposited into your World of Hyatt account as described below. If you are not already a World of Hyatt member, Chase will provide your information to Hyatt upon approval of your Hyatt Credit Card application and Hyatt will enroll you in the World of Hyatt program. World of Hyatt Bonus Points earned through the Hyatt Credit Card can only be transferred to the primary card member's World of Hyatt account. World of Hyatt Bonus Points earned during a billing cycle will be automatically transferred to Hyatt after the end of each billing cycle and will be placed in the member's World of Hyatt account, at which point they will be available to be used. How you could lose Bonus Points that have not yet transferred to Hyatt: You'll immediately lose all World of Hyatt Bonus Points that haven't been transferred to your World of Hyatt account if your card account status changes, or your card account is closed for program misuse, fraudulent activities, failure to pay, bankruptcy, or other reasons described in the terms of the Rewards Program Agreement. Points expiration: The Bonus Points transferred to your World of Hyatt account won't expire as long as your card account is open. If your card account is closed, you will lose any unredeemed points (including Bonus Points) in your World of Hyatt account if you fail to have qualifying activity in the World of Hyatt program at least once every 24 months. Please see the World of Hyatt program terms and conditions at worldofhyatt.com/terms for details on how to keep your account active. Also, if your World of Hyatt account is terminated, any unredeemed points in your World of Hyatt account will be lost. Rewards Categories: Merchants who accept Visa/MasterCard credit cards are assigned a merchant code, which is determined by the merchant or its processor in accordance with Visa/MasterCard procedures based on the kinds of products and services they primarily sell. We group similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers to you. Please note: We make every effort to include all relevant merchant codes in our rewards categories. However, even though a merchant or some of the items that it sells may appear to fit within a rewards category, the merchant may not have a merchant code in that category. When this occurs, purchases with that merchant won't qualify for rewards offers on purchases in that category. Purchases submitted by you, an authorized user, or the merchant through third-party payment accounts, mobile or wireless card readers, online or mobile digital wallets, or similar technology will not qualify in a rewards category if the technology is not set up to process the purchase in that rewards category. For more information about Chase rewards categories, see www.Chase.com/RewardsCategoryFAQs. All World of Hyatt program terms and conditions apply and are available at worldofhyatt.com/terms.

An authorized user will not receive Discoverist status or associated benefits in the World of Hyatt program as a result of his or her designation as an additional authorized user of the Hyatt Credit Card (provided that (s)he may independently enroll in and earn Discoverist status in the World of Hyatt program as otherwise set forth in the World of Hyatt program terms and conditions).

                        Receipt and use of any World of Hyatt™ program points, awards or benefits require membership in the World of Hyatt program. All World of Hyatt points earned through use of the Hyatt Credit Card are "Bonus Points" as defined in the World of Hyatt terms and conditions. Bonus Points may be redeemed for awards in the World of Hyatt program, but are not counted for the purposes of calculating a member's progress towards elite status in the World of Hyatt program. All participation in the World of Hyatt program, including accrual and redemption of points and awards and receipt of membership benefits, is subject to the terms and conditions of the World of Hyatt program. Visit worldofhyatt.com/terms for complete terms and conditions of the World of Hyatt program. Terms and conditions of the World of Hyatt program may be modified and offers, services, and benefits may be added or deleted at any time as described in the World of Hyatt program terms and conditions. Individuals whose request for a credit card is not approved will not be enrolled in the World of Hyatt program through this offer, although existing World of Hyatt memberships will not be affected. Additional authorized users will not be enrolled in the World of Hyatt program as a result of this offer. World of Hyatt Bonus Points awarded through the use of the authorized user's card will only be credited to the primary cardmember's World of Hyatt account. Authorized users will not be eligible for elite status in the World of Hyatt program, or associated benefits, based on their use of the primary cardmember's Hyatt Credit Card.
