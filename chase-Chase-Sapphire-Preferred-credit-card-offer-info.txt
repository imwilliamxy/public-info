       All correspondence, including credit cards, statements, and notifications
 will be sent to the name and address on file for the primary cardmember. The pr
imary cardmember is responsible for repaying all balances on this account. Autho
rized users will have the same account number and charging privileges as the pri
mary cardmember but will not be financially responsible. Chase provides account 
information to the credit reporting agencies for all account users. This informa
tion could impact an authorized user's credit score. When you tell us to add a u
ser to your account, you're confirming that you have a relationship with the per
son or people whose name(s), address(es), and date of birth(s) you've told us, t
hat all their information is correct, and that you have their consent to add the
m. If Chase determines you've given us fraudulent name, address, or date of birt
h information, or did not have such consent, Chase can close this account.

            Rewards Program Agreement: For more information about the Chase Sapp
hire Preferred rewards program, view the latest Rewards Program Agreement. We wi
ll mail your Rewards Program Agreement once your account is established. If you 
become a Chase Online customer, your Rewards Program Agreement will also be avai
lable after logging in to chase.com/ultimaterewards.          How you can earn p
oints: You'll earn points when you, or an authorized user, use a Chase Sapphire 
Preferred credit card to make purchases of products and services, minus returns 
or refunds. Buying products and services with your card, in most cases, will cou
nt as a purchase; however, the following types of transactions won't count and w
on't earn points: balance transfers, cash advances and other cash-like transacti
ons, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting 
transactions, any checks that access your account, interest, unauthorized or fra
udulent charges, and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if applicable. 1
 point: You'll earn 1 point for each $1 spent. 2 points ("2X points"): You'll ea
rn 2 points total for each $1 spent when your card is used for purchases in the 
travel category or the dining at restaurants category (one additional point on t
op of the 1 point per $1 earned on each purchase). How you can use your points: 
You can use your points to redeem for any available reward options, including ca
sh, gift cards, travel, and products or services made available through the prog
ram or directly from third party merchants. Redemption values for reward options
 vary. Points expiration/losing points: Your points don't expire as long as your
 account remains open, however, you will immediately lose all your points if you
r account status changes, or your account is closed for program misuse, fraudule
nt activities, failure to pay, bankruptcy, or other reasons described in the ter
ms of the Rewards Program Agreement. Rewards Categories: Merchants who accept Vi
sa/MasterCard credit cards are assigned a merchant code, which is determined by 
the merchant or its processor in accordance with Visa/MasterCard procedures base
d on the kinds of products and services they primarily sell. We group similar me
rchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers to you. Pleas
e note: We make every effort to include all relevant merchant codes in our rewar
ds categories. However, even though a merchant or some of the items that it sell
s may appear to fit within a rewards category, the merchant may not have a merch
ant code in that category. When this occurs, purchases with that merchant won't 
qualify for rewards offers on purchases in that category. Purchases submitted by
 you, an authorized user, or the merchant through third-party payment accounts, 
mobile or wireless card readers, online or mobile digital wallets, or similar te
chnology will not qualify in a rewards category if the technology is not set up 
to process the purchase in that rewards category. For more information about Cha
se rewards categories, see www.Chase.com/RewardsCategoryFAQs.

e in Travel Redemption                                                          
              When you use points to redeem for cash, each point is worth $.01 (
one cent), which means that 100 points equals $1 in redemption value. Each point
 you redeem for travel booked through Chase Ultimate Rewards is worth $.0125 (on
e and a quarter cents), which means that 100 points equals $1.25 in redemption v
alue, and points are worth 25% more than if redeemed for cash. For example, 50,0
00 points are worth $625 towards travel, or $500 when redeemed for cash. The cos
t of travel is based on the rates and fares available through the Ultimate Rewar
ds website and travel center, and may not reflect all rates and fares that are a
vailable through other sales channels.
