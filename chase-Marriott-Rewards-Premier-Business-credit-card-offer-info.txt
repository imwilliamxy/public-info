ccept Visa/MasterCard credit cards are assigned a merchant code, which is determ
ined by the merchant or its processor in accordance with Visa/MasterCard procedu
res based on the kinds of products and services they primarily sell. We group si
milar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers to yo
u. Please note: We make every effort to include all relevant merchant codes in o
ur rewards categories. However, even though a merchant or some of the items that
 it sells may appear to fit within a rewards category, the merchant may not have
 a merchant code in that category. When this occurs, purchases with that merchan
t won't qualify for rewards offers on purchases in that category. Purchases subm
itted by you, an authorized user, or the merchant through third-party payment ac
counts, mobile or wireless card readers, online or mobile digital wallets, or si
milar technology will not qualify in a rewards category if the technology is not
 set up to process the purchase in that rewards category. For more information a
bout Chase rewards categories, see www.Chase.com/RewardsCategoryFAQs.
