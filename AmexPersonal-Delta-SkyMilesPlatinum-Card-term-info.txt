IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING RATES, FEES, AND OTHER COST INFORMATION
INTEREST RATES AND INTEREST CHARGES
Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for Purchases
17.24% to 26.24%, based on your creditworthiness and other factors as determined at the time of account opening.

This APR will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate.
APR for Balance Transfers
17.24% to 26.24% APR on balance transfers requested within 60 days of account opening based on your creditworthiness and other factors.

This APR will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate.
APR for Cash Advances
26.74%
This APR will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate.
Penalty APR and When it Applies
29.99%
This APR will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate.

This APR may be applied to new transactions on your account if:
1) you make one or more late payments; or
2) your payment is returned by your bank

We may also consider your creditworthiness in determining whether or not to apply the penalty APR to your Account.

How Long Will the Penalty APR Apply? If the Penalty APR is applied, it will apply for at least 6 months. We review your Account every 6 months after the Penalty APR is applied. The Penalty APR will continue to apply until after you have made timely payments, with no returned payments during the 6 months being reviewed.
Paying Interest
Your due date is at least 25 days after the close of each billing period. We will not charge you interest on purchases if you pay each month your entire balance (or if you have a plan outstanding, your balance adjusted for plans) by the due date. We will begin charging interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the transaction date.
Plan Fee
(Fixed Finance Charge)
Up to 1.20% of each purchase moved into a plan based on the plan duration, the APR that would otherwise apply to the purchase and other factors.

How We Will Calculate Your Balance: We use a method called "average daily balance (including new purchases)."
Loss of Introductory APR: We may end your Introductory APR and apply the Penalty APR if you do not pay at least the Minimum Payment Due within 60 days after its Payment Due Date.

The variable penalty APR will not exceed 29.99%.
Variable APRs for each billing period are based on the Prime Rate published in The Wall Street Journal on the Closing Date of the billing period. The Wall Street Journal may not publish the Prime Rate on that day. If it does not, we will use the Prime Rate from the previous day it was published. If the Prime Rate increases, variable APRs will increase. In that case, you may pay more interest and have a higher Minimum Payment Due. When the Prime Rate changes, the resulting changes to variable APRs take effect as of the first day of the billing period. Variable APRs are accurate as of [CURRENT_DATE].

Card Members will receive a statement credit for the first program (either Global Entry or TSA Pre✓®) to which they apply and pay for with their eligible Card. This benefit is not available to Additional Card Members. Card Members can receive no more than one $85 credit or $100 credit, depending on the program for which the Card Member first applies. American Express has no control over the application and/or approval process for Global Entry or TSA Pre✓®, and does not have access to any information provided to the government by the Card Member or by the government to the Card Member. American Express has no liability regarding the Global Entry or TSA Pre✓® programs. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) (for Global Entry) and U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) (for TSA Pre✓®) charge an application fee to process each respective application regardless of whether the Card Member's application is approved. American Express will provide a statement credit for the application fee regardless of the decision made by CBP (for Global Entry) or TSA (for TSA Pre✓®) but will not provide a statement credit for subsequent application fees charged to the same eligible Card within four years, even if the original application is rejected.

Membership for Global Entry or TSA Pre✓® is per person, and a separate application must be completed for each individual. For additional information on the Global Entry and TSA Pre✓® programs, including information regarding the application and/or approval process and for a list of participating airlines and airports, as well as the full terms and conditions of the programs, please go to www.globalentry.gov for Global Entry and www.tsa.gov for TSA Pre✓®.

If you do not see a credit for a qualifying purchase on your eligible Card after 8 weeks, simply call the number on the back of your Card. Card Members are responsible for payment of all application charges until the statement credit posts to the Card account. To be eligible for this benefit, Card account(s) must be active through the time of statement credit fulfillment.

Global Entry Fee Credit Option:
Global Entry is a CBP program that allows expedited clearance for pre-approved, low-risk international travelers upon arrival in the United States. Global Entry membership also includes access to the TSA Pre✓® program with no additional application or fee required. If a Card Member applies separately for TSA Pre✓® with the same eligible Card, the TSA Pre✓® application fee is not eligible for a statement credit. To receive the $100 Global Entry statement credit, Card Members must pay for the $100 Global Entry application fee with an eligible Card. Global Entry members can opt in to TSA Pre✓® by entering their Global Entry membership number (PASS ID) in the "Known Traveler Number" field each time a flight reservation is made on a participating airline. Alternatively, Card Members can add their Global Entry PASS ID to their frequent flyer profile(s) with the participating airline(s) and then ensure that their frequent flyer number is entered for each flight booking.

To receive the $85 TSA Pre✓® statement credit, Card Members must pay for the $85 TSA Pre✓® application fee with an eligible Card. If Card Member is approved, Membership into the TSA Pre✓® program is valid for five years and subject to the program's terms and conditions.

Miles on Eligible Purchases
1x Mile on eligible purchases: You will earn 1 mile for each dollar of eligible purchases charged on your Card.

2x Miles at U.S. Supermarkets: You will earn 1 additional mile (for a total of 2 miles) for each dollar of eligible purchases charged at supermarkets located in the United States. Superstores and warehouse clubs are not considered supermarkets.

2x Miles at Restaurants: You will earn 1 additional mile (for a total of 2 miles) for each dollar of eligible purchases charged at restaurants worldwide. You may not get additional miles for purchases at a restaurant located within another establishment (e.g. a restaurant located inside a hotel, casino, or event venue). For example, purchases made at a restaurant located within a hotel may be recognized as a purchase at a hotel, not a restaurant. You will not earn additional miles for purchases at bars, nightclubs, cafeterias, and convenience stores.

3x Miles at Hotels: You will earn 2 additional miles (for a total of 3 miles) for each dollar of purchases charged directly with hotels worldwide. You will earn additional miles when you pay the hotel directly (e.g. upon check-in or check-out) for a hotel stay that was reserved with a third party, such as an online travel agent. You will not earn additional miles if you prepay for your hotel with a third party, such as an online travel agent, or prepay the hotel as a part of a vacation package. You may not get additional miles for purchases at establishments located inside hotels such as timeshares, spas, restaurants, meeting rooms, event spaces, and banquet halls. You may earn additional miles for incidental charges made directly on the hotel property (including charges made at restaurants, spas, and other establishments), when purchases are charged to your room and paid for with your Card at checkout.

3x Miles on Delta Purchases: You will earn 2 additional miles (for a total of 3 miles) on each dollar of eligible purchases charged directly with Delta ("Delta Purchases"). Delta Purchases are eligible purchases where Delta is the merchant of record, such as purchases via delta.com, the Fly Delta app, phone reservations, or ticket counters, such as upgrades, miles, seat selection, Delta Sky Club® membership, and in-flight purchases of food, alcoholic beverages and audio headsets on Delta-operated flights. Delta Purchases do not include other in-flight purchases where Delta is not the merchant of record, such as in-flight wireless internet access and charitable contributions. Delta Gift Cards do not qualify. Delta Purchases include Delta Vacations® packages but not other all-inclusive packages. Delta Purchases include purchases of qualifying Delta, Delta Connection® carrier and Delta Shuttle® flights taken with the purchase of a fare that is eligible for SkyMiles mileage credit. Additional miles earned for Delta flight purchases made with the Card will be based on the total ticket price, including base fare, carrier-imposed surcharges and government-imposed taxes and fees.

Eligible purchases mean purchases for goods and services minus returns and other credits. Eligible purchases do NOT include fees or interest charges, balance transfers, cash advances, purchases of travelers checks, purchases of gift cards, person-to-person transactions, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, or purchases of other cash equivalents. Miles will be posted to your Delta SkyMiles account 8 to 12 weeks after the end of each month. To be eligible to receive miles, your Card account must not be canceled or past due at the time of fulfillment.

Purchases made through a third party payment account or on an online marketplace (with multiple retailers) will not qualify for additional miles.

Merchants are assigned codes base on what they primarily sell. A purchase will not qualify for additional miles if the merchant's code is not eligible. A purchase may not qualify for additional miles if the merchant submits the purchase using a mobile or wireless card reader or if you use a mobile or digital wallet. Additional terms and restrictions may apply.

Please visit americanexpress.com/rewards-info for more information about rewards.
MQD Waiver
If the Medallion Qualification Dollar (MQD) thresholds are not met for a Qualification Year, you can still qualify for Platinum, Gold and Silver Medallion Status if you have earned the required Medallion Qualification Miles (MQMs) or Medallion Qualification Segments (MQSs) and make at least $25,000 in eligible purchases within that Qualification Year on your Eligible Card. If the MQD threshold is not met for a Qualification Year, you can qualify for Diamond Medallion Status if you have earned the required MQMs or MQSs and make at least $250,000 in eligible purchases within that Qualification Year on your Eligible Card. A Qualification Year is from January 1 to December 31 of a given year. The close of the Qualification Year is December 31, without regard to the time of the year that the credit card account is opened. This means that for the first year of Card Membership, the Card Member's eligible purchase period may be less than twelve months. Eligible purchases means purchases for goods and services minus returns and other credits. Eligible purchases do NOT include fees, interest charges, balance transfers, cash advances, purchases of travelers' checks, person-to-person transactions, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, or purchases of other cash equivalents. Eligible purchases may fall outside of the Qualification Year in some cases, such as a delay in merchants submitting transactions to us or if the purchase date differs from the date you made the transaction. For example, if you buy goods online, the purchase date may be the date the goods are shipped. This may result in a delay in receiving the MQD Waiver. You can confirm whether you have met the eligible purchase threshold for the MQD Waiver by logging into your SkyMiles account on delta.com or in the Fly Delta app. Eligible purchases made by Additional Card Members on the Basic Card Member's Eligible Card Account will count toward the eligible purchase threshold. Eligible Cards are the following: Delta SkyMiles® Platinum Card, Delta SkyMiles® Reserve Card, Delta SkyMiles® Platinum Business Card, and Delta SkyMiles® Reserve Business Card. Other Cards are not eligible for the MQD Waiver. However, if linked to the same SkyMiles number, eligible purchases made on a Delta SkyMiles® Blue Card, Delta SkyMiles® Gold Card, Delta SkyMiles® Business Card, or Delta SkyMiles® Gold Business Card will continue to count towards the MQD Waiver spend threshold requirements. This benefit extends to Basic Card Members only. Additional Card Members are not eligible.
No Foreign Transaction Fees
American Express will not charge any foreign transaction fee on the purchases you make outside of the United States with your Card. However, there may be circumstances where ATMs or merchants charge a fee on foreign transactions.
Pay It
Pay It® is only available in the American Express® App for your eligible Account. With the Pay It feature, you can make a payment equal to the amount of a billed purchase less than $100. Payments made with Pay It are not applied to that billed purchase but to your outstanding balance in accordance with how we apply payments.

Your account is eligible for Pay It if you are a Basic Card Member or Additional Card Member of a Credit Card account issued by a U.S. banking subsidiary of American Express that is not canceled. Prepaid Cards and products, American Express Charge Cards, American Express Corporate Cards, American Express Small Business Cards and American Express-branded cards or account numbers issued by other financial institutions are not eligible.
Pay with Miles
Program is limited to Basic (not Additional) Card Members. New Card Members are eligible to use Pay with Miles upon receipt of their Card. Eligible only on Delta and Delta Connection® carrier-operated and ticketed flights booked at delta.com. Not available on other codeshare flights. Eligible flights for this program will be marked as Pay with Miles eligible. Miles redemptions must be in 5,000 mile increments, with a minimum of 5,000 miles for redemption, and the number of miles redeemed will be rounded up to the nearest 5,000 mile increment, as applicable. Use your Card to pay for the remaining ticket price when using Pay with Miles. Five thousand miles generally provides $50 of value. However, you may receive less value per mile if the cost of a ticket you choose to cover entirely with miles is not a multiple of $50. All Pay with Miles tickets will earn mileage, and will earn Medallion Qualification Dollars, for the portion of the base fare and carrier-imposed surcharges remaining that is paid in currency after miles are applied to the ticket total. Mileage redemption will be applied toward the base fare and carrier-imposed surcharges prior to being applied toward taxes and fees. In addition, all Pay with Miles tickets are eligible for Medallion Qualification Segments, and Medallion Qualification Miles. Pay with Miles tickets are not eligible for Best Fare Guarantee and may not be combined with any other forms of mileage redemption, such as Award Travel tickets. Medallion Complimentary Upgrades on Pay with Miles tickets are subject to availability and may not be eligible on all flights. Except for tickets refunded under Delta's Risk Free Cancellation policy, miles redeemed with Pay with Miles cannot be re-deposited in the member's SkyMiles Account — even for fully refundable fares. Residual value for a changed or cancelled ticket will be issued as an e-certificate applicable to future Delta purchases. For additional terms, conditions, and restrictions, visit delta.com/paywithmiles.
Plan It®
With Plan It®, you can create up to 10 active payment plans, each subject to a plan fee. The plan fee is a fixed finance charge that will be charged each month that the corresponding plan is active.

To create a plan, select qualifying purchases or a qualifying amount of $100 or more and a plan duration. When creating a plan for purchases, you may select up to 10 qualifying purchases for each plan that you create in your American Express online Account. However, you may select only one qualifying purchase for each plan that you create in the American Express App. Plan duration options may vary depending on the total dollar amount of the qualifying purchases or qualifying amount you move into a Plan. Qualifying purchases will be identified in your American Express online Account and American Express App. Qualifying purchases or a qualifying amount do not include purchases of cash or cash equivalents, purchases subject to Foreign Transaction Fees or any fee owed to us, including Annual Membership fees.

Your ability to create plans will be based on a variety of factors such as your creditworthiness or your Credit Limit. You will not be able to create plans if your Account is canceled. You will also not be able to create plans if one or more of your American Express Accounts is enrolled into a debt management program, or has a payment that is returned unpaid, or is delinquent. The number and length of plan duration options offered to you, and the number of active plans you can have at a time, will be at our discretion and will be based on a variety of factors such as your creditworthiness, the purchase amount(s), and your Account history. After a plan is paid in full, it will be removed from your Account in the next billing period.

Plan It is available on Credit Card Accounts issued by a U.S. banking subsidiary of American Express, excluding Accounts with Pay Over Time and Credit Card Accounts that must be paid in full each month. Only the Basic Card Member on the Account can create a plan. Prepaid Cards and products, American Express Corporate Cards, American Express Small Business Cards and American Express-branded Cards or Account numbers issued by other financial institutions are not eligible.

Spending Limits
When you request that we apply a limit as described below on Charges incurred by an Additional Card Member on your Account, you agree to these terms. These terms supplement, and are incorporated by reference into, the terms of your Card Member Agreement.

At your request, we may agree to apply a limit to the total dollar amount of Purchases, during each billing period, that are charged to Card numbers associated with one or more specified Additional Card Members on your Account. At your request, we may agree to apply a limit to the total dollar amount of cash access transactions at ATMs, during each billing period, that are made using Card numbers associated with one or more specified Additional Card Members on your Account. If we agree to apply a limit, it is not a guarantee that the Additional Card Member will be able to make Purchases or cash access transactions up to the applicable limit. In applying any limit we will not take into account any credits (such as for returned merchandise or for payments), even if a credit relates to a Purchase made by the Additional Card Member. Any request that we change a limit may not be effective until a subsequent billing period. Any Charges (as defined below) incurred by the Additional Card Member prior to the date during a billing period that we apply the limit will not be subject to the limit for that billing period.

Because of systems or administrative considerations, arrangements with merchants, or for other business reasons, we may, but are not required to, treat some Purchases and/or cash access transactions (collectively, Charges) as not being subject to any such limits. You agree to pay all Charges without regard to whether any Charges exceed a limit, and you agree that we are not liable to you or any other person when a limit is not applied to any Charges and/or when Charges are incurred and billed that exceed a limit. While we typically require merchants to obtain an authorization for purchases and submit final transaction documentation for payment in a timely manner, a limit may not apply or may be exceeded when a merchant does not obtain an authorization for any reason; when a merchant obtains an authorization for a partial amount of the final charge submitted to us for payment; or when such submissions are not submitted or processed at the same time that the authorization is obtained. Examples may include, but are not limited to: Charges made outside of the U.S., in duty-free stores, or on board airplanes or cruise vessels; international airline ticket Purchases; vehicle rentals; lodging stays extended beyond original reservation period; certain mail order Purchases; Purchases billed on a recurring basis; Purchases at gas stations; telecommunications charges, including charges incurred with calling cards; taxicab charges; security deposits; late, damage or other fees in connection with rentals; Purchases billed in installments; restaurant tips and other gratuities; and Charges that occur before the end of billing period, if the Charge is posted to your Account after the Closing Date of that billing period. Any limit will not be applied to Charges for foreign currency or for travelers cheques or gift cheques obtained other than by telephone from us.

The Spending Limit for the Additional Card Member(s) is optional. If no Spending Limit is set on the Additional Card, spending capacity on this Card will be subject to the Basic Card Member's account terms and conditions.
Split Feature
The split feature ("Split") is only available in the American Express App® to Card Members with an eligible Card. Enrollment required. Eligible Cards include personal American Express Cards issued by a U.S. banking subsidiary of American Express that are not canceled. Prepaid Cards and products, American Express Corporate Cards, American Express Small Business Cards and American Express-branded cards or account numbers issued by other financial institutions are not eligible. To use Split, you must have or create an account with PayPal or Venmo and link your American Express Online Account to your PayPal or Venmo account.

With this feature, you can split purchase amounts that correspond to eligible purchases that are identified in your American Express App and made with an eligible Card. You split these purchase amounts with friends and family by making customized requests to be paid back using your linked account with PayPal or Venmo. Eligible purchases must be at least $1.00 and do not include cash advances or any fee owed to us, including annual membership fees. You cannot split purchases in a Plan It balance. To use Split, you must select an eligible purchase and provide the contact information for friends or family to whom you would like to send a request to be paid back. The total purchase amount will be divided between you and the contacts you select, and requests will be sent to each contact using your linked account with Venmo or PayPal. If a request is accepted, the requested amount will be applied to your linked account with Venmo or PayPal. Your Card Account will be billed for and you are responsible for paying the full purchase amount regardless of whether a request is accepted or rejected. American Express is not responsible for whether requests are accepted and money is paid back to your linked account with Venmo or PayPal. You will earn rewards for purchases that you split in the same way that you would for other purchases that you make with your Card.

Split will be available for a limited time. We plan to launch enhanced features after September 2020 that will require your re-enrollment. We will notify you if and when these features become available.
Status Boost
If in any calendar year eligible purchases on the Delta SkyMiles® Platinum Card are $25,000 or more, the Basic Card Member will be awarded 10,000 Medallion Qualification Miles ("MQMs" as defined in the Delta SkyMiles Membership Guide and Program Rules). If in that same calendar year eligible purchases on the Card are $50,000 or more, the Basic Card Member will be awarded an additional 10,000 MQMs. The close of the calendar year is December 31, without regard to the time of the year that the account is opened. This means that for the first year of Card Membership, the Card Member's eligibility period for the Status Boost™ benefit may be less than twelve months. Eligible purchases means purchases for goods and services minus returns and other credits. Eligible purchases do NOT include fees, interest charges, balance transfers, cash advances, purchases of travelers' checks, purchases of gift cards, person-to-person transactions, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, or purchases of other cash equivalents. Eligible purchases may fall outside of a calendar year in some cases, such as a delay in merchants submitting transactions to us or if the purchase date differs from the date you made the transaction. For example, if you buy goods online, the purchase date may be the date the goods are shipped. Additional Card Member(s) are not eligible to receive MQMs through the Status Boost benefit, however, all eligible purchases by the Additional Card Member(s) will count towards the Basic Card Member's spend level to reach the Status Boost thresholds. To receive the MQMs, your account must not be canceled or past due at the time the MQMs are posted to your account. MQMs only count towards Medallion Status. MQMs cannot be redeemed toward Award Travel or other Delta redemption options. Card Members are only eligible to receive one annual bonus per threshold per calendar year for each type of eligible Delta SkyMiles Card (e.g., Platinum or Reserve) that is linked to the same SkyMiles account. Eligibility for Delta's Medallion Status is not based on MQMs alone. Delta SkyMiles members can qualify for Medallion Status through a combination of miles or segments flown and annual spending. For more information about the requirements for Medallion Status, please visit www.delta.com/en_US/skymiles/medallion-program.
