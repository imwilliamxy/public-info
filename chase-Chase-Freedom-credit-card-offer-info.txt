Complimentary 3 months of DashPass/50% Discounted DashPass from DoorDash for 9 months: Your Chase Freedom account will receive one complimentary 3 month DashPass from DoorDash when the subscription is activated by 12/31/2021. After your complimentary period ends, you'll be automatically enrolled for 9 months at 50% off the then current monthly DashPass rate. After the DashPass discounted period ends, you will continue to be enrolled and charged the then current monthly DashPass rate. You can cancel anytime on the DoorDash mobile application. Subscription will be registered in the name of the primary cardmember or an authorized user, whoever activates the benefit first. Subscription period for the user on a Chase Freedom account will begin and end based on when the first user activates the subscription on the DoorDash mobile application. To receive the subscription benefits, the primary cardmember or authorized user(s) must first add their Chase Freedom card as a payment method in the DoorDash mobile application, and then click the activation button. Benefits of DashPass from DoorDash include no delivery fees on orders that total over $12 (amount subject to change – see DoorDash site for current minimum); however, other fees on food orders may apply. PayPal or digital wallets (like Apple Pay and Google Pay), or subscriptions purchased through third parties are excluded from this offer.

                            Cash Back and Points
                        

Rewards Program Agreement: For more information about the Chase Freedom rewards program, view the latest Rewards Program Agreement Opens in a new window. We will mail your Rewards Program Agreement once your account is established. If you become a Chase Online customer, your Rewards Program Agreement will also be available after logging in to chase.com/ultimaterewards Opens in a new window.
Cash Back and Points: "Cash Back rewards" are the rewards you earn under the program. Cash Back rewards are tracked as points and each $1 in Cash Back rewards earned is equal to 100 points. You may simply see "Cash Back" in marketing materials when referring to the rewards you earn. How you can earn points: You'll earn points when you, or an authorized user, use a Chase Freedom card to make purchases of products and services, minus returns or refunds. Buying products and services with your card, in most cases, will count as a purchase; however, the following types of transactions won't count and won't earn points: balance transfers, cash advances and other cash-like transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting transactions, any checks that access your account, interest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if applicable. 1% Cash Back: You'll earn 1% Cash Back rewards for each $1 spent. 5% Cash Back: You'll earn 5% Cash Back rewards total for each $1 spent until $1,500 is spent on combined purchases in the quarterly bonus categories each quarter that you activate the bonus (4% additional Cash Back rewards on top of the 1% Cash Back rewards earned on each purchase). You must activate your 5% Cash Back bonus each quarter by the activation deadline. 5% Cash Back quarterly bonus categories may include individual select merchants in addition to bonus rewards categories. After $1,500 is spent on combined purchases in the quarterly bonus categories each quarter, you go back to earning 1% Cash Back rewards for every dollar spent, with no maximum. For more information on 5% Cash Back quarterly bonus offers, please visit chase.com/freedom Opens in a new window and select the Chase Freedom FAQs link at the bottom of the page. 
        4% Cash Back on qualifying Lyft rides through 03/2022: You'll earn 4% Cash Back rewards for each $1 spent when your card is used for qualifying Lyft products and services purchased through the Lyft mobile application through 03/31/2022. Qualifying Lyft products and services include rides taken in Classic, Shared, Lux, or XL modes; bike and scooter rides; and subscription and membership products. Purchase of gift cards, car rentals, vehicle service centers, miscellaneous fees, and other Lyft products and services are excluded from this promotion. Future Lyft products or services may not be eligible for additional Cash Back. You may see “5% Cash Back rewards” in marketing materials to refer to the 4% Cash Back rewards earned in addition to the 1% Cash Back rewards earned on all purchases. The additional 4% Cash Back rewards will appear on your billing statement in a separate line from the 1% Cash Back rewards.
        How you can use your points: You can use your points to redeem for any available reward options, including cash, gift cards, travel, and products or services made available through the program or directly from third party merchants. Redemption values for reward options vary. Points expiration/losing points: Your points don't expire as long as your account remains open, however, you will immediately lose all your points if your account status changes, or your account is closed for program misuse, fraudulent activities, failure to pay, bankruptcy, or other reasons described in the terms of the Rewards Program Agreement. Rewards Categories: Merchants who accept Visa/Mastercard credit cards are assigned a merchant code, which is determined by the merchant or its processor in accordance with Visa/Mastercard procedures based on the kinds of products and services they primarily sell. We group similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers to you. Please note: We make every effort to include all relevant merchant codes in our rewards categories. However, even though a merchant or some of the items that it sells may appear to fit within a rewards category, the merchant may not have a merchant code in that category. When this occurs, purchases with that merchant won't qualify for rewards offers on purchases in that category. Purchases submitted by you, an authorized user, or the merchant through third-party payment accounts, mobile or wireless card readers, online or mobile digital wallets, or similar technology will not qualify in a rewards category if the technology is not set up to process the purchase in that rewards category.
