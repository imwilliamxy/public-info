3.2.i.  A Member may redeem Points for up to a total of nine (9) guest rooms at the same Participating Property over the same dates.  When doing so, the Member agrees to make legitimate Point redemption reservations in good faith for use by the Member and his or her invited guests only, and not for any other purposes, including without limitation, reselling, impermissibly assigning or posting on third party websites, or making speculative, false or fraudulent reservations, or any reservation in anticipation of demand.  The Company reserves the right to cancel any reservations it believes to be in violation of the Program Rules.

3.2.j.  If a Participating Property exits the Loyalty Program for any reason after a Member makes an Award Redemption Stay reservation but before the Member’s stay, the Company will use reasonable efforts to have such former Participating Property honor the reservation or assist in arranging equivalent accommodations nearby; however, the Company cannot guarantee that any Awards, upgrades or any other benefits a Member may earn under the Loyalty Program will be honored.
