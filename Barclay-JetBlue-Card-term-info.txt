ures for Opening a New Account: To help the government fight the funding of terr
orism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial instit
utions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who
 opens an account. What this means to you: When you apply for an account, we wil
l ask for your name, street address, date of birth, social security number, and 
other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see cop
ies of identifying documents. We also ask for country of citizenship.Balance Tra
nsfers. Here's How it Works: To request a balance transfer please enter the 15/1
6 digit account number from the Mastercard, Visa, American Express, or Discover 
Card account that you want us to process a balance transfer from. If the total a
mount you request exceeds the assigned credit line on your new account, we may e
ither decline the request or send a partial payment to your creditor(s). The amo
unt of available credit on your new account will be reduced by the amount transf
erred and the related balance transfer fees. We reserve the right to decline to 
process any requested balance transfer. We will not process a request to transfe
r a balance from any other account you may have with us. Balance transfers incur
 interest from the transaction date. You should not transfer the amount of any d
isputed purchase or other charge. If you do, you may lose your dispute rights.Up
on approval of your application we will process the requested balance transfer p
ayment to the account(s) which you have requested on the 10th day after we've ma
iled you your card; during this 10 day time period you may cancel your balance t
ransfer by contacting us at the number on the back of your card. A balance trans
fer may take up to 4 weeks to post to your other accounts. Continue to pay each 
creditor until the balance transfer appears on the other account as a credit. If
 you would like to complete a balance transfer from another account that is not 
a Visa, Mastercard, American Express or Discover Card account, please call the p
hone number on the back of your new credit card once you are approved. Balance t
ransfers are subject to availability. We may deny balance transfer requests at a
ny time and for any reason.Avoiding Interest on Purchases: We will not charge yo
u interest on any purchases if you pay your entire balance by the due date each 
month. In addition, during this introductory period we will not charge you inter
est on purchases if you pay by the due date each month your outstanding statemen
t balance minus any new 0% introductory APR Balance Transfer balances. To avoid 
a late fee, you should pay at least the minimum payment due on your account each
 month.Credit Limit: We do not permit applicants to request a specific credit li
mit. We do not consider a request for a balance transfer made with an applicatio
n to be a request for a particular credit limit. We determine the credit limit o
n your account independent of and prior to processing any balance transfer reque
st.Cash Equivalent Purchases: The purchase of money orders, travelers' checks, f
oreign currency, lottery tickets, gambling chips, wire transfers and other simil
ar transactions are treated as cash advances. Please see your Cardmember Agreeme
nt for details.New York Residents: New York residents may contact the New York S
tate Department of Financial Services by telephone (800) 342-3736, or visit the 
website, www.dfs.ny.gov, for free information on comparative credit card rates, 
fees and grace periods. Notice to Ohio Residents: The Ohio laws against discrimi
