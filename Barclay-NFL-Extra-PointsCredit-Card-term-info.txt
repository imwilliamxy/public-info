er please enter the 15/16 digit account number from the Mastercard, Visa, Americ
an Express, or Discover Card account that you want us to process a balance trans
fer from. If the total amount you request exceeds the assigned credit line on yo
ur new account, we may either decline the request or send a partial payment to y
our creditor(s). The amount of available credit on your new account will be redu
ced by the amount transferred and the related balance transfer fees. We reserve 
the right to decline to process any requested balance transfer. We will not proc
ess a request to transfer a balance from any other account you may have with us.
 Balance transfers incur interest from the transaction date. You should not tran
sfer the amount of any disputed purchase or other charge. If you do, you may los
e your dispute rights.Upon approval of your application we will process the requ
ested balance transfer payment to the account(s) which you have requested on the

ay cancel your balance transfer by contacting us at the number on the back of yo
ur card. A balance transfer may take up to 4 weeks to post to your other account
s. Continue to pay each creditor until the balance transfer appears on the other
 account as a credit. If you would like to complete a balance transfer from anot
her account that is not a Visa, Mastercard, American Express or Discover Card ac
count, please call the phone number on the back of your new credit card once you
 are approved. Balance transfers are subject to availability. We may deny balanc
e transfer requests at any time and for any reason.Avoiding Interest on Purchase

sfer balances. To avoid a late fee, you should pay at least the minimum payment
