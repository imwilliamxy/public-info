Excluded from this Bonus Category are superstores and smaller stores (like drugstores and convenience stores) that sell groceries and other products. 3% Bonus Category: Earn a total of 3% cash back (equal to $0.03, consisting of 2% bonus cash rewards and 1% base cash rewards) for every $1 of Net Purchases made at eligible gas and fuel merchants, which include merchants whose primary line of business is the sale of automotive gasoline that can be purchased inside the service station or at the automated fuel pump and gasoline purchased at boat marinas, as well as fuel dealers whose primary line of business is the sale of heating oil, propane and other fuels, such as kerosene. Purchases made at merchants whose primary line of business is not the sale of automotive gasoline or fuel, like superstores, supermarkets and truck stops will not earn bonus cash rewards. Bonus Category Cap: Grocery store, Wholesale club and Gas purchases earn bonus cash rewards on the first $2,500 of combined Net Purchases made each calendar quarter.

Bonus Category Processing: Merchants are assigned a merchant category code (MCC) based on the merchant's primary line of business. We do not determine which MCC a merchant chooses to classify itself. We group similar MCCs into Bonus Categories to help you earn bonus rewards on purchases made at specific merchants. Your purchase may not qualify to receive the bonus earn rate if the merchant does not process transactions under the MCC that corresponds with the Bonus Category, or your purchase is processed through a third-party payment account, mobile/wireless card reader, digital wallet not supported by Bank of America or similar technology where the technology does not support transmission of MCCs. For those Net Purchases, you will earn base cash rewards of 1%. Not all merchants accept all credit cards.

Overdraft Protection. Overdraft transfers to your eligible Bank of America deposit account from your credit card account will be Bank Cash Advances under your Credit Card Agreement. Transfers will be subject to the terms of both your Credit Card Agreement and the account agreement(s) and disclosures governing your Bank of America deposit account. If you link your Bank of America deposit account to your credit card for Overdraft Protection, we will automatically transfer funds in multiples of $100 from your credit card account to cover any overdraft on your deposit account, as long as the portion of credit available for cash on your credit card account is sufficient and you are not in default under your Credit Card Agreement. A fee of $12 will apply for each transaction. The fee will not be assessed if your deposit account is overdrawn by a total amount less than $12, after we finish processing for the day. The Bank Cash Advance will accrue interest at the APR stated in your Credit Card Agreement. Overdraft Protection transfers incur interest charges from the transaction date.
