s: restaurants, grocery stores and gas stations (for a total of 2% on these purc

ch is determined by the merchant or its processor in accordance with Visa proced
ures based on the kinds of products and services they primarily sell. Chase grou
ps similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers 
to you. Please note: Chase makes every effort to include all relevant merchant c
odes in its rewards categories. However, even though a merchant or some of the i
tems that it sells may appear to fit within a rewards category, the merchant may
 not have a merchant code in that category. When this occurs, purchases with tha
t merchant and the purchases of Disney goods or services at locations that are n
ot solely owned and operated by Disney will not qualify for the additional one p
ercent in Disney Rewards Dollars. Purchases submitted by you, an authorized user
, or the merchant through third-party payment accounts, mobile or wireless card 
readers, online or mobile digital wallets, or similar technology will not qualif
