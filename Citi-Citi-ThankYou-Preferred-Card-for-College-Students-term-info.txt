 Transfer Information                            How to Make Balance Transfers  
                                                         After receiving your ca
rd, you can call the customer service number on the back of your card to transfe
r balances. Balance transfers are made available at our discretion. All balance 
transfers are subject to the standard purchase APR unless an introductory and/or
 other promotional rate applies.

                                 You may transfer any amount, but the total amou
nt of your balance transfer plus balance transfer fees must be less than your av
ailable credit limit. Be sure you don't transfer any disputed purchase or other

d ConditionsWith the Card Account, you can earn ThankYou Points for purchases ma
de on your card.    Unless you are participating in a limited-time offer, you wi
ll earn:-- 2 ThankYou Points for each $1 spent on purchases at restaurants (incl
uding cafes, bars, lounges and fast food restaurants), and on select entertainme
nt, including live entertainment, live theatrical productions, concerts, live sp
orting events, movie theaters, amusement parks (including zoos, aquariums, circu
ses and carnivals), tourist attractions (including museums, and art galleries), 
record stores, video rental stores and on-demand internet streaming media;Certai
n Non-Qualifying Purchases. You won't earn 2X Points for purchases made at baker
ies, certain restaurants/cafes inside department, grocery or warehouse stores, s
porting camps, public and private golf courses, country clubs (including members
hip fees), stores that sell musical instruments, video game arcades, bowling all
eys, stores that primarily sell video games/accessories, charitable organization
s that provide live entertainment, bookstores, and sports complexes where you pa
rticipate in the sport.-- 1 ThankYou Point for each $1 spent on other purchases 
including the non-qualifying purchases listed above.Only Purchases Earn Points. 
Balance transfers, cash advances, checks that access your card account, items re
turned for credit, unauthorized charges, interest and account fees, travelers ch
ecks, foreign currency purchases, money orders, wire transfers (and similar cash
-like transactions), lottery tickets, gaming chips (and similar betting transact
ions) do not earn ThankYou Points.  Each merchant - e.g., a retailer, business o
r any other place where you can make a purchase - is assigned a code that indica
tes the merchant's primary area of business. We don't assign or have any control
 over merchant codes. Codes are chosen and assigned by a third party, who may ch
ange the codes from time to time. When you make a purchase at a merchant, we're 
provided the code for that merchant and if the code matches a category that give
s you additional points, you will earn the additional points. Because we don't c
ontrol what code a merchant is assigned, sometimes a purchase that you think fit
s a certain category may not earn additional points. For example, a restaurant l
ocated within a large retail outlet may not be assigned a "restaurant" code, but
 rather a "retailer" code. This means that if you receive additional points for 
"dining out," you won't earn additional points for purchases at that restaurant.
 Or a restaurant located within a hotel may not be assigned a "restaurant" code,
 but rather a "hotel" code. This means that if you receive more points for purch
ases at a hotel than you receive for purchases at a restaurant, each purchase at
 that restaurant will be treated as a purchase at a hotel, and you'll receive ad
ditional Points. Please see our FAQs at thankyou.com/help or call the ThankYou S
ervice Center at 1-800-THANKYOU (1-800-842-6596) for more information about merc
hant codes and categories.You may earn ThankYou Points as long as your Card Acco
unt is open and current. If your Card Account is closed, you will not be able to
 earn and redeem ThankYou Points and you will lose any accumulated ThankYou Poin
