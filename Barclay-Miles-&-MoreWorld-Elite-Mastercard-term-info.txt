ance Transfers. Here's How it Works: To request a balance transfer please enter 
the 15/16 digit account number from the Mastercard, Visa, American Express, or D
iscover Card account that you want us to process a balance transfer from. If the
 total amount you request exceeds the assigned credit line on your new account, 
we may either decline the request or send a partial payment to your creditor(s).
 The amount of available credit on your new account will be reduced by the amoun
t transferred and the related balance transfer fees. We reserve the right to dec
line to process any requested balance transfer. We will not process a request to
 transfer a balance from any other account you may have with us. Balance transfe
rs incur interest from the transaction date. You should not transfer the amount 
of any disputed purchase or other charge. If you do, you may lose your dispute r
ights.Upon approval of your application we will process the requested balance tr
ansfer payment to the account(s) which you have requested on the 10th day after 
we've mailed you your card; during this 10 day time period you may cancel your b
alance transfer by contacting us at the number on the back of your card. A balan
ce transfer may take up to 4 weeks to post to your other accounts. Continue to p
ay each creditor until the balance transfer appears on the other account as a cr
edit. If you would like to complete a balance transfer from another account that
 is not a Visa, Mastercard, American Express or Discover Card account, please ca
ll the phone number on the back of your new credit card once you are approved. B
alance transfers are subject to availability. We may deny balance transfer reque
sts at any time and for any reason.Avoiding Interest on Purchases: We will not c
harge you interest on any purchases if you pay your entire balance by the due da
te each month. In addition, during this introductory period we will not charge y
ou interest on purchases if you pay by the due date each month your outstanding 
statement balance minus any new 0% introductory APR Balance Transfer balances. T
o avoid a late fee, you should pay at least the minimum payment due on your acco
unt each month.Credit Limit: We do not permit applicants to request a specific c
redit limit. We do not consider a request for a balance transfer made with an ap
plication to be a request for a particular credit limit. We determine the credit
 limit on your account independent of and prior to processing any balance transf
er request.Cash Equivalent Purchases: The purchase of money orders, travelers' c
hecks, foreign currency, lottery tickets, gambling chips, wire transfers and oth
er similar transactions are treated as cash advances. Please see your Cardmember
 Agreement for details.New York Residents: New York residents may contact the Ne
w York State Department of Financial Services by telephone (800) 342-3736, or vi
sit the website, www.dfs.ny.gov, for free information on comparative credit card
 rates, fees and grace periods. Notice to Ohio Residents: The Ohio laws against 
discrimination require that all creditors make credit equally available to all c
reditworthy customers, and that credit reporting agencies maintain separate cred
it histories on each individual upon request.  The Ohio Civil Rights Commission 
administers compliance with this law.Notice to Married Wisconsin Residents: No m
arital property agreement, unilateral statement or court decree under Wisconsin'
