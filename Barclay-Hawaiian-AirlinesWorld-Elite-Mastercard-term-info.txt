ransfers. Here's How it Works: To request a balance transfer please enter the 15
/16 digit account number from the Mastercard, Visa, American Express, or Discove
r Card account that you want us to process a balance transfer from. If the total
 amount you request exceeds the assigned credit line on your new account, we may
 either decline the request or send a partial payment to your creditor(s). The a
mount of available credit on your new account will be reduced by the amount tran
sferred and the related balance transfer fees. We reserve the right to decline t
o process any requested balance transfer. We will not process a request to trans
fer a balance from any other account you may have with us. Balance transfers inc
ur interest from the transaction date. You should not transfer the amount of any
 disputed purchase or other charge. If you do, you may lose your dispute rights.
Upon approval of your application we will process the requested balance transfer
 payment to the account(s) which you have requested on the 10th day after we've 
mailed you your card; during this 10 day time period you may cancel your balance
 transfer by contacting us at the number on the back of your card. A balance tra
nsfer may take up to 4 weeks to post to your other accounts. Continue to pay eac
h creditor until the balance transfer appears on the other account as a credit. 
If you would like to complete a balance transfer from another account that is no
t a Visa, Mastercard, American Express or Discover Card account, please call the
 phone number on the back of your new credit card once you are approved. Balance
 transfers are subject to availability. We may deny balance transfer requests at
 any time and for any reason.Avoiding Interest on Purchases: We will not charge 
you interest on any purchases if you pay your entire balance by the due date eac
h month. In addition, during this introductory period we will not charge you int
erest on purchases if you pay by the due date each month your outstanding statem
ent balance minus any new 0% introductory APR Balance Transfer balances. To avoi
d a late fee, you should pay at least the minimum payment due on your account ea
ch month.Credit Limit: We do not permit applicants to request a specific credit 
limit. We do not consider a request for a balance transfer made with an applicat
ion to be a request for a particular credit limit. We determine the credit limit
 on your account independent of and prior to processing any balance transfer req
uest.Cash Equivalent Purchases: The purchase of money orders, travelers' checks,
 foreign currency, lottery tickets, gambling chips, wire transfers and other sim
