Medallion Qualification Dollar WaiverIf the Medallion Qualification Dollar (MQD) threshold is not met for a Qualification Year, you can still qualify for Platinum, Gold and Silver Medallion Status if you have earned the required Medallion Qualification Miles (MQMs) or Medallion Qualification Segments (MQSs) and make at least $25,000 in Eligible Purchases within that Qualification Year on your Eligible Card. If the MQD threshold is not met for a Qualification Year, you can qualify for Diamond Medallion Status if you have earned the required MQMs or MQSs and spend at least $250,000 in eligible purchases within that Qualification Year on your Eligible Card. A Qualification Year is from January 1 to December 31 of a given year. The close of the Qualification Year is December 31, without regard to the time of the year that the credit card account is opened. This means that for the first year of Card Membership, the Card Member's Eligible Purchase period may be less than twelve months. Eligible Purchases means purchases for goods and services minus returns and other credits. Eligible Purchases do NOT include fees, interest charges, balance transfers (balance transfers are not available on Delta SkyMiles® Business Credit Cards), cash advances, purchases of travelers' checks, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, or purchases of other cash equivalents. Eligible purchases may fall outside of the Qualification Year in some cases, such as a delay in merchants submitting transactions to us or if the purchase date differs from the date you made the transaction.

You can confirm whether you have met the Eligible Purchase threshold for the MQD Waiver by logging into your SkyMiles account on delta.com or in the Fly Delta app. Eligible Purchases made by Additional Card Members on the Basic Card Member's Eligible Card will count toward the Eligible Purchase threshold.

Eligible Cards are the following: Gold Delta SkyMiles Credit Card, Platinum Delta SkyMiles, Delta Reserve Credit Card, Delta SkyMiles Business Credit Card, Gold Delta SkyMiles Business Credit Card, Platinum Delta SkyMiles Business Credit Card, Delta Reserve for Business Credit Card from American Express. The Blue Delta SkyMiles® Credit Card is not eligible for the MQD Waiver. However, if you have another Delta SkyMiles Credit Card with the MQD Waiver benefit in addition to your Delta Blue SkyMiles Credit Card, Eligible Purchases made on the Blue Delta SkyMiles Credit Card will continue to count towards the MQD Waiver. This benefit extends to Basic Card Members only (Additional Card Members are not eligible). Offer terms and conditions subject to change.
