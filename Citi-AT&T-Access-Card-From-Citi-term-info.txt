se that you think fits a certain category may not earn additional points. For ex
ample, a restaurant located within a large retail outlet may not be assigned a "
restaurant" code, but rather a "retailer" code. This means that if you receive a
dditional points for "dining out," you won't earn additional points for purchase
s at that restaurant. Or a restaurant located within a hotel may not be assigned
 a "restaurant" code, but rather a "hotel" code. This means that if you receive 
more points for purchases at a hotel than you receive for purchases at a restaur
ant, each purchase at that restaurant will be treated as a purchase at a hotel, 
and you'll receive additional Points. Please see our FAQs at thankyou.com/help o
