Telecommunications merchants are classified as merchants that sell telecommunications equipment such as telephones, fax machines, pagers, and cellular phones, along with providers of telecommunications services including local and long-distance telephone calls and fax services. Car rental merchants are classified as providers of short-term or long-term rentals of cars, trucks, or vans. Cable and satellite providers are classified as merchants that provide the connection and ongoing delivery of television, internet (computer network, information services, email website hosting services) telephone and radio programming via cable or satellite on a subscription or fee basis. Gas stations are classified as merchants that sell fuel primarily for consumer use and may or may not be attended.Certain Non-Qualifying Purchases: Car rental purchases not eligible to receive double miles include purchases at merchants that rent motor homes or other recreational vehicles and purchases made through travel agencies, tour operators and online third party travel sites. Gas station purchases not eligible to receive double miles include, but are not limited to, purchases made at warehouse clubs that do not code gas station purchases under a gas station code, discount stores, department stores and convenience stores.Each merchant – e.g., a retailer, business or any other place where you can make a purchase – is assigned a code that indicates the merchant's primary area of business. We don't assign or have any control over merchant codes. Codes are assigned by a third party. When you make a purchase at a merchant, we're provided the code for that merchant and if the code matches a category that gives you additional miles, you will earn the additional miles. Because we don't control what code a merchant is assigned, sometimes a purchase that you think fits a certain category may not earn additional miles. For example, a restaurant located within a large retail outlet may not be assigned a "restaurant" code, but rather a "retailer" code. This means that if you receive additional miles for "purchases at restaurants," you won't earn additional miles for purchases at that restaurant.Citi® reserves the right to determine which purchases qualify for this offer.
