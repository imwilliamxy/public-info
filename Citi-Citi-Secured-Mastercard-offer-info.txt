To receive a Citi® Secured Mastercard® you must meet our credit qualification criteria for this card, which includes our review of your income and your debt. If approved, your security deposit must be equal to your credit limit. You must not have any bankruptcy history within the last two years.
If you are approved for the card, provide a security deposit for the amount of your credit limit, between $200-$2,500. Your security deposit will be equal to the amount of your credit limit. Your security deposit will be held in a Collateral Holding Account for an initial term of up to 18 months and will not earn interest. Unless Citi determines your account is eligible to have your deposit returned, you must keep your CHA open for the full 18 months. If your Citi Secured credit card account is in default or is not renewed, we may apply your security deposit to the outstanding credit card balance and close your account.
