To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activ
ities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and re
cord information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this mea
ns to you: When you apply for an account, we will ask for your name, street addr
ess, date of birth, social security number, and other information that will allo
w us to identify you. We may also ask to see copies of identifying documents. We
 also ask for country of citizenship.Balance Transfers. Here's How it Works: To 
request a balance transfer please enter the 15/16 digit account number from the 
Mastercard, Visa, American Express, or Discover Card account that you want us to
 process a balance transfer from. If the total amount you request exceeds the as
signed credit line on your new account, we may either decline the request or sen
d a partial payment to your creditor(s). The amount of available credit on your 
new account will be reduced by the amount transferred and the related balance tr
ansfer fees. We reserve the right to decline to process any requested balance tr
ansfer. We will not process a request to transfer a balance from any other accou
nt you may have with us. Balance transfers incur interest from the transaction d
ate. You should not transfer the amount of any disputed purchase or other charge
. If you do, you may lose your dispute rights.Upon approval of your application 
we will process the requested balance transfer payment to the account(s) which y
ou have requested on the 10th day after we've mailed you your card; during this 
10 day time period you may cancel your balance transfer by contacting us at the 
number on the back of your card. A balance transfer may take up to 4 weeks to po
st to your other accounts. Continue to pay each creditor until the balance trans
fer appears on the other account as a credit. If you would like to complete a ba
lance transfer from another account that is not a Visa, Mastercard, American Exp
ress or Discover Card account, please call the phone number on the back of your 
new credit card once you are approved. Balance transfers are subject to availabi
lity. We may deny balance transfer requests at any time and for any reason.Avoid
ing Interest on Purchases: We will not charge you interest on any purchases if y
ou pay your entire balance by the due date each month. In addition, during this 
introductory period we will not charge you interest on purchases if you pay by t
he due date each month your outstanding statement balance minus any new 0% intro
ductory APR Balance Transfer balances. To avoid a late fee, you should pay at le
ast the minimum payment due on your account each month.Credit Limit: We do not p
ermit applicants to request a specific credit limit. We do not consider a reques
t for a balance transfer made with an application to be a request for a particul
ar credit limit. We determine the credit limit on your account independent of an
d prior to processing any balance transfer request.Cash Equivalent Purchases: Th
e purchase of money orders, travelers' checks, foreign currency, lottery tickets
, gambling chips, wire transfers and other similar transactions are treated as c
ash advances. Please see your Cardmember Agreement for details.New York Resident
s: New York residents may contact the New York State Department of Financial Ser
vices by telephone (800) 342-3736, or visit the website, www.dfs.ny.gov, for fre
e information on comparative credit card rates, fees and grace periods. Notice t
o Ohio Residents: The Ohio laws against discrimination require that all creditor
s make credit equally available to all creditworthy customers, and that credit r
eporting agencies maintain separate credit histories on each individual upon req
uest.  The Ohio Civil Rights Commission administers compliance with this law.Not
ice to Married Wisconsin Residents: No marital property agreement, unilateral st
atement or court decree under Wisconsin's marital property law will adversely af
