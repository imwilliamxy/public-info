However, if you pay for gasoline at the pump please note many pumps seek a preauthorization before allowing you to use the Card which could be up to $75 or more. This is called a "Preauthorization Request". If you have insufficient funds on your Card to cover the "Preauthorization Request", the Card may be declined. When a merchant submits this Preauthorization Request, we will hold the amount of the Preauthorization Request until the final transaction is cleared. If the total cost of your gasoline purchase is less than the Preauthorization Request, we will release the difference between the total gasoline purchase and the Preauthorization Request, typically within 8 business days. During the period when funds are temporarily held, funds will not be available for use.Lowest Hotel Rates GuaranteeValid only for American Express Card Members.
