Payment amounts in excess of your Total Minimum Payment Due will be applied to balances with higher APRs before balances with lower APRs.

The following transactions are not considered purchases and will not earn points: Balance Transfers and Cash Advances (each as defined in your Credit Card Agreement), fees, interest charges, fraudulent transactions and certain other charges. Unlimited 1.5 Points: Earn 1.5 base points for every $1 of Net Purchases (non-Travel and Dining) charged to the card each billing cycle. 2 Points: Earn 2 base points for every $1 of Net Purchases made with the card in the Travel and Dining category, with no limit on the number of points you can earn. Travel and Dining Category: Dining includes Restaurants, including Fast Food, and Drinking Establishments, such as Bars or Taverns. Travel includes: airlines, hotels, motels, timeshares, trailer parks, motor home and recreational vehicle rentals, campgrounds, car rental agencies, truck and trailer rental, cruise lines, travel agencies, tour operators and real estate agents, operators of passenger trains, buses, taxis, limousines, ferries, boat rentals, parking lots and garages, tolls and bridge fees, tourist attractions and exhibits like art galleries, amusement parks, carnivals, circuses, aquariums, zoos and the like.

Your purchase may not qualify to receive the Travel and Dining category earn rate if the merchant does not process transactions under the MCC that corresponds with the Travel and Dining Category, or your purchase is processed through a third-party payment account, mobile/wireless card reader, digital wallet not supported by Bank of America or similar technology where the technology does not support transmission of MCCs. For those Net Purchases, you will earn 1.5 base points per $1. Not all merchants accept all credit cards.

If you link your Bank of America deposit account to your credit card for Overdraft Protection, we will automatically transfer funds in multiples of $100 from your credit card account to cover any overdraft on your deposit account, as long as the portion of credit available for cash on your credit card account is sufficient and you are not in default under your Credit Card Agreement. A fee of $12 will apply for each transaction.

Linking Overdraft Protection from your Bank of America credit card to your Bank of America deposit account will end any other Overdraft Protection connections to your deposit account.
