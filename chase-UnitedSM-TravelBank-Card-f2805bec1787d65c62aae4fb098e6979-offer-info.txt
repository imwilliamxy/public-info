Buying products and services with your card, in most cases, will count as a purchase; however, the following types of transactions won't count and won't earn TravelBank cash: balance transfers, cash advances and other cash-like transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting transactions, any checks that access your account, interest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if applicable. 2% in TravelBank cash: You'll earn 2% in TravelBank cash for each $1 spent on airline tickets purchased directly from United. 1.5% in TravelBank cash: You'll earn 1.5% in TravelBank cash for each $1 spent on all other purchases.

TravelBank cash expiration: The TravelBank cash transferred to your United TravelBank account will expire in accordance with the TravelBank Program Rules. TravelBank cash won't expire as long as there is qualifying activity in your United TravelBank account, as described in the TravelBank Program Rules. For example, TravelBank cash posting to your United TravelBank account from card earning activity qualifies as activity. Losing TravelBank cash: You'll immediately lose all TravelBank cash that hasn't been transferred to United if your card account status changes, or your card account is closed for program misuse, fraudulent activities, failure to pay, bankruptcy, or other reasons described in the terms of the Rewards Program Agreement.

Chase's sole obligation concerning the award and redemption of TravelBank cash shall be to make a valid request to United to award TravelBank cash to the Cardmember's associated TravelBank account. Chase disclaims liability or responsibility for United's failure to award or redeem TravelBank cash to the Cardmember's associated TravelBank account after Chase has met its obligations to United in connection with such a request. Benefits are available as long as Cardmember is a member in good standing of MileagePlus and Cardmember's TravelBank Credit Card account is open and not in default. Upon closure of the Cardmember's TravelBank Credit Card account, all benefits will be canceled.
