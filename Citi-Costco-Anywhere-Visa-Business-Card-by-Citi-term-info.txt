 Account will earn Costco Cash Rewards based on your purchases that can be redee
med for merchandise or cash back at any U.S. Costco warehouse, including Puerto 
Rico ("Costco Cash Rewards").                             Earning Costco Cash Re
wards on Purchases: You'll earn Costco Cash Rewards for purchases using your Car
d Account, minus returns and refunds, as follows:                            4% 
cash back on eligible gas worldwide, including gas at  Costco, for the first $7,
000 per year in gas purchases and then 1% thereafter.                           
                 Certain Non-Qualifying Purchases. You will only earn 1% cash ba
ck, not 4%, for gas purchased at superstores, supermarkets, convenience stores a
nd warehouse clubs other than Costco or for fuel used for non-automobile purpose
s.                                                                        3% cas
h back on restaurant (including cafes, bars, lounges  and fast food restaurants)
 and eligible travel purchases worldwide, including airfare, hotels, car rentals
, travel  agencies, cruise lines and Costco Travel.                             
               Certain Non-Qualifying Purchases. You will only earn 1%, not 3%, 
for purchases made at bakeries and certain restaurants/cafes inside department s
tores, grocery or warehouse clubs.                                              
                          2% cash back on all other purchases from Costco and Co
stco.com.                                                    1% cash back on all
 other purchases, including the non-qualifying purchases listed above.          
                              Merchant Classification: Each merchant - that is a
 retailer, business or any other place where you can make a purchase - is assign
ed a code that indicates the merchant's area of business. For example, restauran
ts are generally assigned a specific merchant code. We don't assign or have any 
control over merchant codes. Codes are chosen and assigned by a third party, who
 may change the codes from time to time. When you make a purchase at a merchant,
 we're provided the code for that merchant. If the code matches a category that 
gives you additional Costco Cash Rewards - for example, if the merchant code tel
ls us that you made a purchase at a restaurant - we'll give you the additional C
ostco Cash Rewards for that purchase. Because we don't control what code a merch
ant is assigned, sometimes a purchase that you think fits a certain category may
 not earn additional Costco Cash Rewards. For example, a restaurant located with
in a large retail outlet may not be assigned a "restaurant" code, but rather a "
retailer" code. This means that even though you receive additional Costco Cash R
ewards for purchases at "restaurants," you won't earn additional Costco Cash Rew
ards for purchases at that restaurant.            What doesn't qualify as a purc
hase?: The following types of transactions don't qualify as purchases that earn 
Costco Cash Rewards:                            Use of checks that access your C
ard Account                Balance transfers                Cash advances       
                             Travelers checks, foreign currency purchases, money
 orders, wire transfers and similar cash-like transactions                      
          Lottery tickets, gaming chips and similar betting transactions        
        Interest and account fees                Unauthorized charges           
     Items returned for credit                        Returns: Returned items ma
y result in credits being applied to your Card Account which will reduce or may 
eliminate accumulated Costco Cash Rewards and may result in a negative cash rewa
rds balance. If your Card Account has a negative Costco Cash Rewards balance, an
y newly earned Costco Cash Rewards will be used to offset such negative Costco C
ash Rewards balance until such balance has been brought to zero.            You 
must maintain your Costco Membership to receive and redeem your Costco Cash Rewa
rds.            Redeeming Costco Cash Rewards: Your reward is distributed annual
ly, in the form of a credit card reward certificate, once your February billing 
statement closes, and is redeemable through December 31 of the year issued in a 
single transaction at any U.S. Costco warehouse, including in Puerto Rico, for m
erchandise or cash back. The credit card reward certificate will contain your Co
stco Cash Rewards balance based on your eligible purchases during the annual rew
ard period. The annual reward period is based on January through December billin
g statements. Should you choose to redeem only a portion of the certificate for 
merchandise, you will receive the remaining balance in cash at the Costco wareho
use register upon checkout. Some warehouses may not permit the credit card rewar
d certificate to be redeemed for alcohol purchases. Requests for cash may be ful
filled in the form of a check at  Costco's  discretion. Your credit card reward 
certificate must be redeemed in person on or prior to its expiration date of Dec
ember 31 in the year in which it is issued. Any Costco Cash Rewards you have ear
ned on purchases made by authorized users on your Card Account will be added to 
your Costco Cash Rewards total. Only you, the authorized officer, are eligible t
o receive the annual credit card reward certificate; however, you or anyone you 
authorize may redeem the certificate. You will not receive a credit card reward 
certificate if your reward is less than $1 or your account is closed at the time
 your credit card reward certificate is scheduled to be sent; any Costco Cash Re
wards that had been accrued at that time will be forfeited. You must maintain yo
ur Costco Membership to redeem your  credit card reward certificate.            
Account Closure: If we close your Card Account, you will no longer be able to ea
rn Costco Cash Rewards, and you will forfeit any Costco Cash Rewards accumulated
, but not yet distributed. If you close or convert your Card Account prior to re
ceiving the credit card reward certificate in your February billing statement, a
ny earned Costco Cash Rewards will be forfeited.            Forfeiture: All Cost
co Cash Rewards not disbursed via an annual credit card reward certificate due t
o the reward amount being less than $1, the account status (including account cl
osure), or other reasons, will be forfeited. Additionally, any Costco Cash Rewar
ds not redeemed by December 31 of the year of issuance of the credit card reward
 certificate will be forfeited.            Value of Costco Cash Rewards: Costco 
Cash Rewards have no cash value until such time as they are redeemed at a Costco
 warehouse.            Property Rights: You have no property rights or other leg
al interests in Costco Cash Rewards. Costco Cash Rewards may not be transferred 
to any other person including through such events as inheritance, bankruptcy or 
divorce. Costco Cash Rewards cannot be assigned or pledged.            Changes t
o Program Rules: We may make changes to the Costco Cash Rewards Program at any t
ime without notice. We will give you 30 days' written notice if we make any of t
he following changes: a change that negatively affects the number of Costco Cash
