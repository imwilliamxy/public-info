 security number, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We m
ay also ask to see copies of identifying documents. We also ask for country of c
itizenship.Balance Transfers. Here's How it Works: To request a balance transfer
 please enter the 15/16 digit account number from the Mastercard, Visa, American
 Express, or Discover Card account that you want us to process a balance transfe
r from. If the total amount you request exceeds the assigned credit line on your
 new account, we may either decline the request or send a partial payment to you
r creditor(s). The amount of available credit on your new account will be reduce
d by the amount transferred and the related balance transfer fees. We reserve th
e right to decline to process any requested balance transfer. We will not proces
s a request to transfer a balance from any other account you may have with us. B
alance transfers incur interest from the transaction date. You should not transf
er the amount of any disputed purchase or other charge. If you do, you may lose 
your dispute rights.Upon approval of your application we will process the reques
ted balance transfer payment to the account(s) which you have requested on the 1
0th day after we've mailed you your card; during this 10 day time period you may
 cancel your balance transfer by contacting us at the number on the back of your
 card. A balance transfer may take up to 4 weeks to post to your other accounts.
 Continue to pay each creditor until the balance transfer appears on the other a
ccount as a credit. If you would like to complete a balance transfer from anothe
r account that is not a Visa, Mastercard, American Express or Discover Card acco
unt, please call the phone number on the back of your new credit card once you a
re approved. Balance transfers are subject to availability. We may deny balance 
transfer requests at any time and for any reason.Avoiding Interest on Purchases:
 We will not charge you interest on any purchases if you pay your entire balance
 by the due date each month. In addition, during this introductory period we wil
l not charge you interest on purchases if you pay by the due date each month you
r outstanding statement balance minus any new 0% introductory APR Balance Transf
er balances. To avoid a late fee, you should pay at least the minimum payment du
e on your account each month.Credit Limit: We do not permit applicants to reques
t a specific credit limit. We do not consider a request for a balance transfer m
ade with an application to be a request for a particular credit limit. We determ
ine the credit limit on your account independent of and prior to processing any 
balance transfer request.Cash Equivalent Purchases: The purchase of money orders
, travelers' checks, foreign currency, lottery tickets, gambling chips, wire tra
nsfers and other similar transactions are treated as cash advances. Please see y
