    All correspondence, including credit cards, statements, and notifications wi
ll be sent to the name and address on file for the primary cardmember. The prima
ry cardmember is responsible for repaying all balances on this account. Authoriz

y cardmember but will not be financially responsible. Chase provides account inf
ormation to the credit reporting agencies for all account users. This informatio
n could impact an authorized user's credit score. When you tell us to add a user
 to your account, you're confirming that you have a relationship with the person
 or people whose name(s), address(es), and date of birth(s) you've told us, that
 all their information is correct, and that you have their consent to add them. 
If Chase determines you've given us fraudulent name, address, or date of birth i
nformation, or did not have such consent, Chase can close this account.

                    Zero Liability Protection does not apply to use of an accoun

                           Rewards Program Agreement: For more information about
 the Chase Freedom rewards program, view the latest Rewards Program Agreement. W
e will mail your Rewards Program Agreement once your account is established. If 
you become a Chase Online customer, your Rewards Program Agreement will also be 
available after logging in to chase.com/ultimaterewards.        Cash Back and Po
ints: "Cash Back rewards" are the rewards you earn under the program. Cash Back 
rewards are tracked as points and each $1 in Cash Back rewards earned is equal t
o 100 points. You may simply see "Cash Back" in marketing materials when referri
ng to the rewards you earn. How you can earn points: You'll earn points when you
, or an authorized user, use a Chase Freedom card to make purchases of products 
and services, minus returns or refunds. Buying products and services with your c
ard, in most cases, will count as a purchase; however, the following types of tr
ansactions won't count and won't earn points: balance transfers, cash advances a
nd other cash-like transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race trac
k wagers or similar betting transactions, any checks that access your account, i
nterest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, and fees of any kind, including an 
annual fee, if applicable. 1% Cash Back: You'll earn 1% Cash Back rewards for ea
ch $1 spent. 5% Cash Back: You'll earn 5% Cash Back rewards total for each $1 sp
ent until $1,500 is spent on combined purchases in the quarterly bonus categorie
s each quarter that you activate the bonus (4% additional Cash Back rewards on t
op of the 1% Cash Back rewards earned on each purchase). You must activate your 
5% Cash Back bonus each quarter by the activation deadline. 5% Cash Back quarter
ly bonus categories may include individual select merchants in addition to bonus
 rewards categories. After $1,500 is spent on combined purchases in the quarterl
y bonus categories each quarter, you go back to earning 1% Cash Back rewards for
 every dollar spent, with no maximum. For more information on 5% Cash Back quart
erly bonus offers, please visit chase.com/freedom and select the Chase Freedom F
AQs link at the bottom of the page. How you can use your points: You can use you
r points to redeem for any available reward options, including cash, gift cards,
 travel, and products or services made available through the program or directly
 from third party merchants. Redemption values for reward options vary. Points e
xpiration/losing points: Your points don't expire as long as your account remain
s open, however, you will immediately lose all your points if your account statu
s changes, or your account is closed for program misuse, fraudulent activities, 
failure to pay, bankruptcy, or other reasons described in the terms of the Rewar
ds Program Agreement. Rewards Categories: Merchants who accept Visa/MasterCard c
redit cards are assigned a merchant code, which is determined by the merchant or
 its processor in accordance with Visa/MasterCard procedures based on the kinds 
of products and services they primarily sell. We group similar merchant codes in
to categories for purposes of making rewards offers to you. Please note: We make
 every effort to include all relevant merchant codes in our rewards categories. 
However, even though a merchant or some of the items that it sells may appear to
 fit within a rewards category, the merchant may not have a merchant code in tha
t category. When this occurs, purchases with that merchant won't qualify for rew
ards offers on purchases in that category. Purchases submitted by you, an author
ized user, or the merchant through third-party payment accounts, mobile or wirel
ess card readers, online or mobile digital wallets, or similar technology will n
ot qualify in a rewards category if the technology is not set up to process the 
purchase in that rewards category. For more information about Chase rewards cate
gories, see www.Chase.com/RewardsCategoryFAQs.
