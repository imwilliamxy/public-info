IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING RATES, FEES, AND OTHER COST INFORMATION
INTEREST RATES AND INTEREST CHARGES
Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for Purchases
15.74% to 24.74%, based on your creditworthiness and other factors as determined at the time of account opening.

This APR will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate.
APR for Balance Transfers
15.74% to 24.74% APR on balance transfers requested within 60 days of account opening based on your creditworthiness and other factors.

This APR will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate.
APR for Cash Advances
25.24%
This APR will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate.
Penalty APR and When it Applies
29.24%
This APR will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate.

This APR may be applied to new transactions on your account if:
1) you make one or more late payments; or
2) your payment is returned by your bank

We may also consider your creditworthiness in determining whether or not to apply the penalty APR to your Account.

How Long Will the Penalty APR Apply? If the Penalty APR is applied, it will apply for at least 6 months. We review your Account every 6 months after the Penalty APR is applied. The Penalty APR will continue to apply until after you have made timely payments, with no returned payments during the 6 months being reviewed.
Paying Interest
Your due date is at least 25 days after the close of each billing period. We will not charge you interest on purchases if you pay each month your entire balance (or if you have a plan outstanding, your balance adjusted for plans) by the due date. We will begin charging interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the transaction date.
Plan Fee
(Fixed Finance Charge)
Up to 1.21% of each purchase moved into a plan based on the plan duration, the APR that would otherwise apply to the purchase and other factors.

How We Will Calculate Your Balance: We use a method called "average daily balance (including new purchases)."
Loss of Introductory APR: We may end your Introductory APR and apply the Penalty APR if you do not pay at least the Minimum Payment Due within 60 days after its Payment Due Date.

The variable penalty APR will not exceed 29.99%.
Variable APRs for each billing period are based on the Prime Rate published in The Wall Street Journal on the Closing Date of the billing period. The Wall Street Journal may not publish the Prime Rate on that day. If it does not, we will use the Prime Rate from the previous day it was published. If the Prime Rate increases, variable APRs will increase. In that case, you may pay more interest and have a higher Minimum Payment Due. When the Prime Rate changes, the resulting changes to variable APRs take effect as of the first day of the billing period. Variable APRs are accurate as of [CURRENT_DATE].

In applying any limit we will not take into account any credits (such as for returned merchandise or for payments), even if a credit relates to a Purchase made by the Additional Card Member. Any request that we change a limit may not be effective until a subsequent billing period. Any Charges (as defined below) incurred by the Additional Card Member prior to the date during a billing period that we apply the limit will not be subject to the limit for that billing period.

Because of systems or administrative considerations, arrangements with merchants, or for other business reasons, we may, but are not required to, treat some Purchases and/or cash access transactions (collectively, Charges) as not being subject to any such limits. You agree to pay all Charges without regard to whether any Charges exceed a limit, and you agree that we are not liable to you or any other person when a limit is not applied to any Charges and/or when Charges are incurred and billed that exceed a limit. While we typically require merchants to obtain an authorization for purchases and submit final transaction documentation for payment in a timely manner, a limit may not apply or may be exceeded when a merchant does not obtain an authorization for any reason; when a merchant obtains an authorization for a partial amount of the final charge submitted to us for payment; or when such submissions are not submitted or processed at the same time that the authorization is obtained. Examples may include, but are not limited to: Charges made outside of the U.S., in duty-free stores, or on board airplanes or cruise vessels; international airline ticket Purchases; vehicle rentals; lodging stays extended beyond original reservation period; certain mail order Purchases; Purchases billed on a recurring basis; Purchases at gas stations; telecommunications charges, including charges incurred with calling cards; taxicab charges; security deposits; late, damage or other fees in connection with rentals; Purchases billed in installments; restaurant tips and other gratuities; and Charges that occur before the end of billing period, if the Charge is posted to your Account after the Closing Date of that billing period. Any limit will not be applied to Charges for foreign currency or for travelers cheques or gift cheques obtained other than by telephone from us.

The Spending Limit for the Additional Card Member(s) is optional. If no Spending Limit is set on the Additional Card, spending capacity on this Card will be subject to the Basic Card Member's account terms and conditions.
Split Feature
The split feature ("Split") is only available in the American Express App® to Card Members with an eligible Card. Enrollment required. Eligible Cards include personal American Express Cards issued by a U.S. banking subsidiary of American Express that are not canceled. Prepaid Cards and products, American Express Corporate Cards, American Express Small Business Cards and American Express-branded cards or account numbers issued by other financial institutions are not eligible. To use Split, you must have or create an account with PayPal or Venmo and link your American Express Online Account to your PayPal or Venmo account.

With this feature, you can split purchase amounts that correspond to eligible purchases that are identified in your American Express App and made with an eligible Card. You split these purchase amounts with friends and family by making customized requests to be paid back using your linked account with PayPal or Venmo. Eligible purchases must be at least $1.00 and do not include cash advances or any fee owed to us, including annual membership fees. You cannot split purchases in a Plan It balance. To use Split, you must select an eligible purchase and provide the contact information for friends or family to whom you would like to send a request to be paid back. The total purchase amount will be divided between you and the contacts you select, and requests will be sent to each contact using your linked account with Venmo or PayPal. If a request is accepted, the requested amount will be applied to your linked account with Venmo or PayPal. Your Card Account will be billed for and you are responsible for paying the full purchase amount regardless of whether a request is accepted or rejected. American Express is not responsible for whether requests are accepted and money is paid back to your linked account with Venmo or PayPal. You will earn rewards for purchases that you split in the same way that you would for other purchases that you make with your Card.

Split will be available for a limited time. We plan to launch enhanced features after September 2020 that will require your re-enrollment. We will notify you if and when these features become available.
