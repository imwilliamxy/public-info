g a New Account: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money
 laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtai
n, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an accou
nt. What this means to you: When you apply for an account, we will ask for your 
name, street address, date of birth, social security number, and other informati
on that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see copies of identify
ing documents. We also ask for country of citizenship.Balance Transfers. Here's 
How it Works: To request a balance transfer please enter the 15/16 digit account
 number from the Mastercard, Visa, American Express, or Discover Card account th
at you want us to process a balance transfer from. If the total amount you reque
st exceeds the assigned credit line on your new account, we may either decline t
he request or send a partial payment to your creditor(s). The amount of availabl
e credit on your new account will be reduced by the amount transferred and the r
elated balance transfer fees. We reserve the right to decline to process any req
uested balance transfer. We will not process a request to transfer a balance fro
m any other account you may have with us. Balance transfers incur interest from 
the transaction date. You should not transfer the amount of any disputed purchas
e or other charge. If you do, you may lose your dispute rights.Upon approval of 
your application we will process the requested balance transfer payment to the a
ccount(s) which you have requested on the 10th day after we've mailed you your c
ard; during this 10 day time period you may cancel your balance transfer by cont
acting us at the number on the back of your card. A balance transfer may take up
 to 4 weeks to post to your other accounts. Continue to pay each creditor until 
the balance transfer appears on the other account as a credit. If you would like
 to complete a balance transfer from another account that is not a Visa, Masterc
ard, American Express or Discover Card account, please call the phone number on 
the back of your new credit card once you are approved. Balance transfers are su
bject to availability. We may deny balance transfer requests at any time and for
 any reason.Avoiding Interest on Purchases: We will not charge you interest on a
ny purchases if you pay your entire balance by the due date each month. In addit
ion, during this introductory period we will not charge you interest on purchase
s if you pay by the due date each month your outstanding statement balance minus
 any new 0% introductory APR Balance Transfer balances. To avoid a late fee, you
 should pay at least the minimum payment due on your account each month.Credit L
imit: We do not permit applicants to request a specific credit limit. We do not 
consider a request for a balance transfer made with an application to be a reque
st for a particular credit limit. We determine the credit limit on your account 
independent of and prior to processing any balance transfer request.Cash Equival
ent Purchases: The purchase of money orders, travelers' checks, foreign currency
, lottery tickets, gambling chips, wire transfers and other similar transactions
 are treated as cash advances. Please see your Cardmember Agreement for details.
