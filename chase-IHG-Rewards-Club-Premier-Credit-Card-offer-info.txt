wards Categories: Merchants who accept Visa/MasterCard credit cards are assigned
 a merchant code, which is determined by the merchant or its processor in accord
ance with Visa/MasterCard procedures based on the kinds of products and services
 they primarily sell. We group similar merchant codes into categories for purpos
es of making rewards offers to you. Please note: We make every effort to include
 all relevant merchant codes in our rewards categories. However, even though a m
erchant or some of the items that it sells may appear to fit within a rewards ca
tegory, the merchant may not have a merchant code in that category. When this oc
curs, purchases with that merchant won't qualify for rewards offers on purchases
 in that category. Purchases submitted by you, an authorized user, or the mercha
nt through third-party payment accounts, mobile or wireless card readers, online
 or mobile digital wallets, or similar technology will not qualify in a rewards 
category if the technology is not set up to process the purchase in that rewards
 category. For more information about Chase rewards categories, see www.Chase.co
