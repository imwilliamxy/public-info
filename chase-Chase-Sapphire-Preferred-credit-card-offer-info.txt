                                               Rewards Program Agreement: For mo
re information about the Chase Sapphire Preferred rewards program, view the late
st Rewards Program Agreement. We will mail your Rewards Program Agreement once y
our account is established. If you become a Chase Online customer, your Rewards 
Program Agreement will also be available after logging in to chase.com/ultimater
ewards.          How you can earn points: You'll earn points when you, or an aut
horized user, use a Chase Sapphire Preferred credit card to make purchases of pr
oducts and services, minus returns or refunds. Buying products and services with
 your card, in most cases, will count as a purchase; however, the following type
s of transactions won't count and won't earn points: balance transfers, cash adv
ances and other cash-like transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, ra
ce track wagers or similar betting transactions, any checks that access your acc
ount, interest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, and fees of any kind, includ
ing an annual fee, if applicable. 1 point: You'll earn 1 point for each $1 spent
. 2 points ("2X points"): You'll earn 2 points total for each $1 spent when your
 card is used for purchases in the travel category or the dining at restaurants 
category (one additional point on top of the 1 point per $1 earned on each purch
ase). How you can use your points: You can use your points to redeem for any ava
ilable reward options, including cash, gift cards, travel, and products or servi
ces made available through the program or directly from third party merchants. R
edemption values for reward options vary. Points expiration/losing points: Your 
points don't expire as long as your account remains open, however, you will imme
diately lose all your points if your account status changes, or your account is 
closed for program misuse, fraudulent activities, failure to pay, bankruptcy, or
 other reasons described in the terms of the Rewards Program Agreement. Rewards 
Categories: Merchants who accept Visa/MasterCard credit cards are assigned a mer
chant code, which is determined by the merchant or its processor in accordance w
ith Visa/MasterCard procedures based on the kinds of products and services they 
primarily sell. We group similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of 
making rewards offers to you. Please note: We make every effort to include all r
elevant merchant codes in our rewards categories. However, even though a merchan
t or some of the items that it sells may appear to fit within a rewards category
, the merchant may not have a merchant code in that category. When this occurs, 
purchases with that merchant won't qualify for rewards offers on purchases in th
at category. Purchases submitted by you, an authorized user, or the merchant thr
ough third-party payment accounts, mobile or wireless card readers, online or mo
bile digital wallets, or similar technology will not qualify in a rewards catego
ry if the technology is not set up to process the purchase in that rewards categ
ory. For more information about Chase rewards categories, see www.Chase.com/Rewa
rdsCategoryFAQs.                                                                
                            25% More in Travel Redemption                       
                                                 When you use points to redeem f
or cash, each point is worth $.01 (one cent), which means that 100 points equals
 $1 in redemption value. Each point you redeem for travel booked through Chase U
ltimate Rewards is worth $.0125 (one and a quarter cents), which means that 100 
points equals $1.25 in redemption value, and points are worth 25% more than if r
edeemed for cash. For example, 80,000 points are worth $1,000 towards travel, or
 $800 when redeemed for cash. The cost of travel is based on the rates and fares
 available through the Ultimate Rewards website and travel center, and may not r
eflect all rates and fares that are available through other sales channels.
