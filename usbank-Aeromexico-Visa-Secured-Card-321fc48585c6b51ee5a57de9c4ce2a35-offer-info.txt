How Secured Credit Cards Work
 To fund your Secured Card, print an application and mail a Cashier’s Check or Money Order ($300 minimum, $5,000 maximum).
If your application is approved, we’ll send you a credit card with a credit line the same as your deposit.
The deposit is used to open a U.S. Bank Secured Savings Account (SSA) to ensure your card can be paid. The secured savings account is FDIC-insured, earns interest and won’t be touched unless you are in default under the terms of your Cardmember Agreement.
Transactions with the card are billed to you each month as with any credit card. You’re responsible for making at least your minimum payment by the due date; payments are not automatically deducted from your secured savings account.
When you’ve managed all of your credit obligations responsibly consistently for 12 months, you’ll be well on your way to a strong credit standing, and we may be able to move you to an unsecured credit card product.
