I would recommend it to a friend but here are my grievances against it and why I give it a 3 out of 5 for online. For the record, I value things in the following order: value given, easy of use, convenience, and simplicity. If those are different for you, no need to read on.Their app isn't as clean and easy to use as other sites such as Discover. It is not always simple and easy to use, both app and website which I do not enjoy. I'd add that they limit you to ONLY spend the rewards on something that Costco offers. You have to spend it physically at a Costco or online. They don't have the same partnerships as a discover where you can simply get the money as cash in a variety of ways. I would  love to see them add a few partnerships outside their store or give cashback as cash rather than store credit. We almost lost last year's cashback because we didn't realize it expired and required their check. Not a fan of either of those.But in the grand scheme of life, they are rather non-essential to the card and it's function. It is still a wonderful card and I LOVE 4% cashback on gas. Other than those changes I'd like to see, it does a great job. I'd still recommend it with those imperfections!More DetailsCustomer Service5Rated 5 out of 5 starsOnline Account Access3Rated 3 out of 5 starsBottom Line Yes, I would recommend to a friend Was this review helpful to you?00Flag this review3Rated 3 out of 5 starsOversea operators are not good as well as the US onesSubmitted  9 days ago                                              By                                            JAB                                                              From                                        Kingwood, Texas                  Verified BuyerVerified BuyerVerified BuyerOversea operators are not good as well as the US ones.
