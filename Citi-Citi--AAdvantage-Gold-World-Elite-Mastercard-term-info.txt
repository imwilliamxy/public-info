 available at our discretion. All balance transfers are subject to the standard 
purchase APR unless an introductory and/or other promotional rate applies.      
                                              If we give you the option to trans
fer a balance with your application, it will take at least 14 days after your Ca
rd Account is opened to process any balance transfer payments. During this time,
 you may cancel or modify your balance transfer request by calling the number on
 the back of your card.                                                    You m
