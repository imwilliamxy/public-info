Card Members who do not change their airline selection will remain with their current airline.
The qualifying airline Business Platinum Card Members select for this $200 benefit and the 35% Airline Bonus must be the same.
Statement Credits: Incidental air travel fees must be charged to the Card Member on the eligible Card Account for the benefit to apply.
Incidental air travel fees charged by both the Basic and Additional Card Members on the eligible Card Account are eligible for statement credits.

Please allow 2-4 weeks after the qualifying incidental air travel fee is charged to your Card Account for statement credit(s) to be posted to the Account.

The Travel Collection member benefits, amenities and offers are subject to change.
For complete program terms on The Travel Collection by Travel Leaders Group visit thetravelcollection.vacation.com/Public/Program-Terms.Upgrade with Points Terms and ConditionsWhen you use Upgrade with Points to request an airline ticket upgrade, three things will happen: (i) If the airline upgrades your ticket(s), your Card Account will be charged for the upgrade; (ii) American Express will deduct the Membership Rewards points you offered for the upgrade from your program account; and (iii) American Express will apply an accompanying credit to your Card Account for those points.
If the airline upgrades your ticket(s) and the number of points available in your Membership Rewards program account is less than the number of points you originally offered, American Express will deduct only the number of points available and you will receive an accompanying credit only for that number of points.
The credit to your Card Account may appear during a different billing cycle than the charge for upgrade.
You are still responsible for paying the amount due on your Card statement by the due date.
Any applicable taxes and fees in connection with an airline ticket upgrade will be charged to your Card Account and cannot be covered with points.
The value of the points you offer is determined at the time your upgrade offer is accepted by the airline and may change after your upgrade offer has been submitted if you subsequently upgrade or downgrade your Card Account.
Once accepted by the airline, your upgrade offer is nonrefundable, non-changeable, and points cannot be returned to your Membership Rewards program account.
 Each airline determines whether to accept upgrade offers and which upgrade offers it will accept based on factors it determines in its discretion, including the amount of an offer.
While it is possible for airlines to accept an upgrade offer at any time after offer submission, most upgrades are processed between 5 and 1 days before departure, and some are processed as close as 1 hour before departure.
If your flight reservation includes tickets for more than one passenger, the tickets for all passengers on the reservation will be upgraded if your upgrade offer is accepted by the airline.
If you would like to upgrade only certain passengers, you must contact the airline to split your reservation prior to requesting an upgrade.
If your Card offers additional points for flights purchased directly from an airline, you will not receive additional points for your upgrade purchase.
