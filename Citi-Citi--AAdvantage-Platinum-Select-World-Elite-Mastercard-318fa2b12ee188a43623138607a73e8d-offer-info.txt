Solid Card

Solid card. The annual fees are raising the price of it but for a single card user, it seems to be a good balance given the benefits.

Terrible! Very unhappy with you

I'm so very tired of how you process my payments which tend to benefit you, where you are able to charge me interest when it shouldn't happen. I am seriously considering dropping you as my only credit card. I do make sure to tell everyone I know how terrible you are.

Pretty good, with a glaring deficiency.

I've had this card for a couple of decades. Obviously, I like it. But... boggles my mind that CitiAadvantage won't let it be used for Google Pay. One of the two or three most widely used mobile payment and digital wallet service, but this card can't be used for it.

Have been a sincerely loyal AA Advantage card member for many years...but using the points just gets harder and harder. We are seriously shopping for another card.

It won't always work for online purchases

Too often I cannot make a purchase online. I get a message that there is a problem. Then I have to choose a different card. Very frustrating!

I'm not going to keep this card it is not a good value

It's good for Citi but not good for customers. When I go to redeem miles the flights are terrible and the costs to upgrade is crazy. I'm going to look for a better card.
