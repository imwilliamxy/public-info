                IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT - To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. This means that we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you when you open an account. We may also ask to see your driver's license or other identifying documents; and obtain identification information about you or any authorized user you add to your account.

		credit line increases or decreases, collection and other servicing of the Card Account, and offering other products and services 
		and for any other uses permitted by law. If you ask us, we'll tell you whether or not we requested a credit bureau report and the

                the Card Agreement will take effect if you do not cancel your Card Account within 30 days after we send you the Card Agreement.

<h2>Balance Transfer Information</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="font-bold">How to Make Balance Transfers</span>
            </p>

            <ul class="numbered-list">
                <li>
                   After receiving your card, you can call the customer service number on the back of your card to transfer balances. Balance transfers are made available at our discretion. All balance transfers are subject to the standard purchase APR unless an introductory and/or other promotional rate applies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If we give you the option to transfer a balance with your application, it will take at least 14 days after your Card Account is opened to process any balance transfer payments. During this time, you may cancel or modify your balance transfer request by calling the number on the back of your card.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You may transfer any amount, but the total amount of your balance transfer plus balance transfer fees must be less than your available revolving credit limit. Be sure you don't transfer any disputed purchase or other charge amount because you may lose your dispute rights. You cannot transfer balances from other accounts issued by Citi or its affiliates. If you are unsure of the issuer on the account, please visit <a href="https://www.citi.com/affiliatesproducts" target="_blank">www.citi.com/affiliatesproducts</a> for a list of Citi products and affiliates.</li>
<li>Continue to make payments on your other accounts until you have confirmed this balance transfer has been received. Once approved, we'll pay the amount of the balance transfer directly to that issuer. The available revolving credit limit for your new card will be reduced by the total amount of the transfers, including fees we approve.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><span class="font-bold">Things You Should Know About Your Balance Transfer Offer:</span></p>

   <p>If you transfer a balance with this offer, interest will be charged on purchases made with your credit card unless your purchases have a 0% APR or you pay the New Balance shown on your statement (including the amount of your balance transfer) in full by the payment due date each billing period.</p>
<p>If you default under your Card Agreement you may lose any promotional APR on the balance transfer.</p>

<h2>Citi<sup>®</sup> ThankYou<sup>®</sup> Rewards</h2>
<p><span class="font-bold">Summary of the Citi Prestige<sup>®</sup> Card Terms and Conditions</span></p>
<p>With the Citi Prestige Card, you can earn ThankYou Points for purchases made on your card. Unless you are participating in a limited‐time offer, you will earn:</p>
<p>-- 3 ThankYou Points for each $1 spent on purchases at airlines, hotels and travel agencies.</p>
<p>-- 2 ThankYou Points for each $1 spent on purchases at restaurants (including cafes, bars, lounges and fast food restaurants), and on select entertainment, including live entertainment, live theatrical productions, concerts, live sporting events, movie theaters, amusement parks (including zoos, aquariums, circuses and carnivals), tourist attractions (including museums, and art galleries), record stores, video rental stores and on-demand internet streaming media;</p>
<p><span class="font-bold">Certain Non-Qualifying Purchases.</span> You won't earn 2X Points for purchases made at bakeries, restaurants/cafes inside certain department, grocery or warehouse stores, sporting camps, public and private golf courses, country clubs (including membership fees), stores that sell musical instruments, video game arcades, bowling alleys, stores that primarily sell video games/accessories, charitable organizations that provide live entertainment, bookstores, sports complexes where you participate in the sport.</p>
<p>-- 1 ThankYou Point for each $1 spent on other purchases including the non-qualifying purchases listed above.</p>
<p><span class="font-bold">Only Purchases Earn Points.</span> You'll earn Points for purchases using your Card Account, minus returns and refunds. The following types of transactions don't qualify as purchases that earn points: use of checks that access your card account, balance transfers, cash advances, travelers checks, foreign currency purchases, money orders, wire transfers and similar cash‐like transactions, lottery tickets, gaming chips and similar betting transactions, interest and account fees, unauthorized charges, items returned for credit</p>
<p><span class="font-bold">Merchant Codes.</span> Each merchant ‐ e.g., a retailer, business or any other place where you can make a purchase ‐ is assigned a code that indicates the merchant's area of business. For example, restaurants are generally assigned a specific merchant code. We don't assign or have any control over merchant codes. Codes are chosen and assigned by a third party, who may change the codes from time to time. When you make a purchase at a merchant, we're provided the code for that merchant. If the code matches a category that gives you additional Points ‐ for example, if the merchant code tells us that you made a purchase at a restaurant, and you get additional Points for "dining out" purchases ‐ we'll give you the additional Points. Because we don't control what code a merchant is assigned, sometimes a purchase that you think fits a certain category may not earn additional Points. For example, a restaurant located within a large retail outlet may not be assigned a "restaurant" code, but rather a "retailer" code. This means that if you receive additional Points for "dining out," you won't earn additional Points for purchases at that restaurant. Or a restaurant located within a hotel may not be assigned a "restaurant" code, but rather a "hotel" code. This means that if you receive more Points for purchases at a hotel than you receive for purchases at a restaurant, each purchase at that restaurant will be treated as a purchase at a hotel, and you'll receive additional Points.

Please allow 1-2 billing cycles after the qualifying air travel expense is charged to your Card Account for statement credit(s) to be posted to the account.</p>

Cardmembers are responsible for payment of all charges on the Card Account regardless of eligibility for statement credit. To be eligible for this benefit, the enrolled Card Account must be open and current at the time of statement credit fulfillment.</p>
