                            Earning Points
                        

Rewards Program Agreement: For more information about the Chase Sapphire Reserve rewards program, view the latest Rewards Program Agreement Opens in a new window. We will mail your Rewards Program Agreement once your account is established. If you become a Chase Online customer, your Rewards Program Agreement will also be available after logging in to chase.com/ultimaterewards Opens in a new window.
How you can earn points: You'll earn points when you, or an authorized user, use a Chase Sapphire Reserve credit card to make purchases of products and services, minus returns or refunds. Buying products and services with your card, in most cases, will count as a purchase; however, the following types of transactions won't count and won't earn points: travel purchases that qualify for the $300 Annual Travel Credit, balance transfers, cash advances and other cash-like transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting transactions, any checks that access your account, interest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if applicable. 3 points ("3X points") on travel purchases: You'll earn 3 points for each $1 after the first $300 is spent annually when your card is used for purchases in the travel category. Therefore, any purchases that qualify for the $300 Annual Travel Credit will not earn points. "Annually" means the year beginning with your account open date through the first statement date after your account open date anniversary, and the 12 monthly billing cycles after that each year. 3 points ("3X points") on dining at restaurants: You'll earn 3 points for each $1 spent when your card is used for purchases in the dining at restaurants category. 1 point ("1X points"): You'll earn 1 point for each $1 spent on all other purchases. How you can use your points: You can use your points to redeem for any available reward options, including cash, gift cards, travel, and products or services made available through the program or directly from third-party merchants. Redemption values for reward options vary. Points expiration/losing points: Your points don't expire as long as your account remains open, however, you will immediately lose all your points if your account status changes, or your account is closed for program misuse, fraudulent activities, failure to pay, bankruptcy, or other reasons described in the terms of the Rewards Program Agreement. Rewards Categories: Merchants who accept Visa/MasterCard credit cards are assigned a merchant code, which is determined by the merchant or its processor in accordance with Visa/MasterCard procedures based on the kinds of products and services they primarily sell. We group similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers to you. Please note: We make every effort to include all relevant merchant codes in our rewards categories. However, even though a merchant or some of the items that it sells may appear to fit within a rewards category, the merchant may not have a merchant code in that category. When this occurs, purchases with that merchant won't qualify for rewards offers on purchases in that category. Purchases submitted by you, an authorized user, or the merchant through third-party payment accounts, mobile or wireless card readers, online or mobile digital wallets, or similar technology will not qualify in a rewards category if the technology is not set up to process the purchase in that rewards category.

                            50% More in Travel Redemption
                        

                        When you use points to redeem for cash, each point is worth $.01 (one cent), which means that 100 points equals $1 in redemption value. Each point you redeem for travel booked through Chase Ultimate Rewards is worth $.0150 (one and a half cents), which means that 100 points equals $1.50 in redemption value, and points are worth 50% more than if redeemed for cash. For example, 50,000 points are worth $750 towards travel, or $500 when redeemed for cash. The cost of travel is based on the rates and fares available through the Ultimate Rewards website and travel center, and may not reflect all rates and fares that are available through other sales channels.
                    


                            $300 Annual Travel Credit
                        

                        A statement credit will automatically be applied to your account when your card is used for purchases in the travel category, up to an annual maximum accumulation of $300. Annual means the year beginning with your account open date through the first statement date after your account open date anniversary, and the 12 monthly billing cycles after that each year. (For applications submitted before May 21, 2017, annual means the year beginning with your account open date through the first December statement date of that same year, and the 12 billing cycles starting after your December statement date through the following December statement date each year.) Call the number on the back of your card to see when you are eligible for your next $300 Annual Travel Credit. Purchases are when you, or an authorized user, use a card to make purchases of products and services. Buying products and services with your card, in most cases, will count as a purchase; however, the following types of transactions won't count: balance transfers, cash advances, travelers checks, foreign currency, money orders, wire transfers or similar cash-like transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting transactions, any checks that access your account, interest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if applicable. We do not determine whether merchants correctly identify and bill transactions as being of a certain type. For more information about Chase rewards categories, see chase.com/RewardsCategoryFAQs Opens in a new window. Statement credit(s) will post to your account the same day your travel category purchase posts to your account and will appear on your monthly credit card billing statement within 1-2 billing cycles. The Annual Travel Credit will be issued for the year in which the transaction posts to your account. For example, if you pay for baggage fees, but the airline does not post the transaction until after the current annual period ends, the cost of the baggage fees will be allocated towards the following year's Annual Travel Credit maximum of $300.
