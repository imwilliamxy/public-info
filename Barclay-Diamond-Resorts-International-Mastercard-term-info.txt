 government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Fede
ral law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record inform
ation that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means to you: 
When you apply for an account, we will ask for your name, street address, date o
f birth, social security number, and other information that will allow us to ide
ntify you. We may also ask to see copies of identifying documents. We also ask f
or country of citizenship.Balance Transfers. Here's How it Works: To request a b
alance transfer please enter the 15/16 digit account number from the Mastercard,
 Visa, American Express, or Discover Card account that you want us to process a 
balance transfer from. If the total amount you request exceeds the assigned cred
it line on your new account, we may either decline the request or send a partial
 payment to your creditor(s). The amount of available credit on your new account
 will be reduced by the amount transferred and the related balance transfer fees
. We reserve the right to decline to process any requested balance transfer. We 
will not process a request to transfer a balance from any other account you may 
have with us. Balance transfers incur interest from the transaction date. You sh
ould not transfer the amount of any disputed purchase or other charge. If you do
, you may lose your dispute rights.Upon approval of your application we will pro
cess the requested balance transfer payment to the account(s) which you have req
uested on the 10th day after we've mailed you your card; during this 10 day time
 period you may cancel your balance transfer by contacting us at the number on t
he back of your card. A balance transfer may take up to 4 weeks to post to your 
other accounts. Continue to pay each creditor until the balance transfer appears
 on the other account as a credit. If you would like to complete a balance trans
fer from another account that is not a Visa, Mastercard, American Express or Dis
cover Card account, please call the phone number on the back of your new credit 
card once you are approved. Balance transfers are subject to availability. We ma
y deny balance transfer requests at any time and for any reason.Avoiding Interes
t on Purchases: We will not charge you interest on any purchases if you pay your
 entire balance by the due date each month. In addition, during this introductor
y period we will not charge you interest on purchases if you pay by the due date
 each month your outstanding statement balance minus any new 0% introductory APR
 Balance Transfer balances. To avoid a late fee, you should pay at least the min
imum payment due on your account each month.Credit Limit: We do not permit appli
cants to request a specific credit limit. We do not consider a request for a bal
ance transfer made with an application to be a request for a particular credit l
imit. We determine the credit limit on your account independent of and prior to 
processing any balance transfer request.Cash Equivalent Purchases: The purchase 
of money orders, travelers' checks, foreign currency, lottery tickets, gambling 
chips, wire transfers and other similar transactions are treated as cash advance
s. Please see your Cardmember Agreement for details.New York Residents: New York
