.Balance Transfers. Here's How it Works: To request a balance transfer please en
ter the 15/16 digit account number from the Mastercard, Visa, American Express, 
or Discover Card account that you want us to process a balance transfer from. If
 the total amount you request exceeds the assigned credit line on your new accou
nt, we may either decline the request or send a partial payment to your creditor
(s). The amount of available credit on your new account will be reduced by the a
mount transferred and the related balance transfer fees. We reserve the right to
 decline to process any requested balance transfer. We will not process a reques
t to transfer a balance from any other account you may have with us. Balance tra
nsfers incur interest from the transaction date. You should not transfer the amo
unt of any disputed purchase or other charge. If you do, you may lose your dispu
te rights. Upon approval of your application we will process the requested balan
ce transfer payment to the account(s) which you have requested on the 10th day a
fter we've mailed you your card; during this 10 day time period you may cancel y
our balance transfer by contacting us at the number on the back of your card. A 
balance transfer may take up to 4 weeks to post to your other accounts. Continue
 to pay each creditor until the balance transfer appears on the other account as
 a credit. If you would like to complete a balance transfer from another account
 that is not a Visa, Mastercard, American Express or Discover Card account, plea
se call the phone number on the back of your new credit card once you are approv
ed. Balance transfers are subject to availability. We may deny balance transfer 
requests at any time and for any reason.Credit Limit: We do not permit applicant
s to request a specific credit limit. We do not consider a request for a balance
 transfer made with an application to be a request for a particular credit limit
. We determine the credit limit on your account independent of and prior to proc
essing any balance transfer request.Cash Equivalent Purchases: The purchase of m
oney orders, travelers' checks, foreign currency, lottery tickets, gambling chip
s, wire transfers and other similar transactions are treated as cash advances. P
lease see your Cardmember Agreement for details.New York Residents: New York res
idents may contact the New York State Department of Financial Services by teleph
