                       Rewards Program Agreement: For more information about the
 Chase Sapphire Preferred rewards program, view the latest Rewards Program Agree
ment. We will mail your Rewards Program Agreement once your account is establish
ed. If you become a Chase Online customer, your Rewards Program Agreement will a
lso be available after logging in to chase.com/ultimaterewards.          How you
 can earn points: You'll earn points when you, or an authorized user, use a Chas
e Sapphire Preferred credit card to make purchases of products and services, min
us returns or refunds. Buying products and services with your card, in most case
s, will count as a purchase; however, the following types of transactions won't 
count and won't earn points: balance transfers, cash advances and other cash-lik
e transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or simil
ar betting transactions, any checks that access your account, interest, unauthor
ized or fraudulent charges, and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if ap
plicable. 1 point: You'll earn 1 point for each $1 spent. 2 points ("2X points")
: You'll earn 2 points total for each $1 spent when your card is used for purcha
ses in the travel category or the dining at restaurants category (one additional
 point on top of the 1 point per $1 earned on each purchase). How you can use yo
ur points: You can use your points to redeem for any available reward options, i
ncluding cash, gift cards, travel, and products or services made available throu
gh the program or directly from third party merchants. Redemption values for rew
ard options vary. Points expiration/losing points: Your points don't expire as l
ong as your account remains open, however, you will immediately lose all your po
ints if your account status changes, or your account is closed for program misus
e, fraudulent activities, failure to pay, bankruptcy, or other reasons described
 in the terms of the Rewards Program Agreement. Rewards Categories: Merchants wh
o accept Visa/MasterCard credit cards are assigned a merchant code, which is det
ermined by the merchant or its processor in accordance with Visa/MasterCard proc
edures based on the kinds of products and services they primarily sell. We group
 similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers to
 you. Please note: We make every effort to include all relevant merchant codes i
n our rewards categories. However, even though a merchant or some of the items t
hat it sells may appear to fit within a rewards category, the merchant may not h
ave a merchant code in that category. When this occurs, purchases with that merc
hant won't qualify for rewards offers on purchases in that category. Purchases s
ubmitted by you, an authorized user, or the merchant through third-party payment
 accounts, mobile or wireless card readers, online or mobile digital wallets, or
 similar technology will not qualify in a rewards category if the technology is 
not set up to process the purchase in that rewards category. For more informatio
n about Chase rewards categories, see www.Chase.com/RewardsCategoryFAQs.        
                                                                                
    25% More in Travel Redemption                                               
                         When you use points to redeem for cash, each point is w
orth $.01 (one cent), which means that 100 points equals $1 in redemption value.
 Each point you redeem for travel booked through Chase Ultimate Rewards is worth
 $.0125 (one and a quarter cents), which means that 100 points equals $1.25 in r
edemption value, and points are worth 25% more than if redeemed for cash. For ex
ample, 80,000 points are worth $1,000 towards travel, or $800 when redeemed for 
cash. The cost of travel is based on the rates and fares available through the U
ltimate Rewards website and travel center, and may not reflect all rates and far
es that are available through other sales channels.
