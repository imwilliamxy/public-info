             One-time 25,000 bonus FlexPoints will be awarded when you are approved for a new U.S. Bank FlexPerks Travel Rewards Visa Signature Card and eligible Net Purchases totaling $2,000 or more are made to your account within four months from account opening. Net purchases are purchases minus credits and returns. Rewards are earned based on eligible net purchases. Not all transactions are eligible to earn rewards, such as Advances, Balance Transfers, and Convenience Checks; upon approval, see your Cardmember Agreement for details. Please allow 6-8 weeks for your bonus FlexPoints to be credited to your FlexPerks account. You are eligible to receive one-time bonus FlexPoints for each new FlexPerks Travel Rewards Visa account type. Existing and previous FlexPerks Travel Rewards Visa accounts do not qualify for bonus FlexPoints for a similar account type. One-time bonus FlexPoints do not apply toward account upgrades. Use of the FlexPerks Travel Rewards Card is subject to terms and conditions of the FlexPerks Travel Rewards Cardmember Agreement, which may be amended from time to time. This offer may not be combined with any other bonus offer. Offer is subject to credit approval. 
            Cash back is redeemed in the form of a statement credit or a deposit made to your U.S. Bank Savings, Checking, or Money Market Account based on your designation, or as a U.S. Bank Rewards Card ($20 minimum redemption). Available Travel Rewards, Gift Certificate Rewards, Merchandise Rewards, Magazines and any other Program Rewards, and the number of FlexPoints needed to obtain each reward, are available to Cardmembers at the Rewards Center or by phone at 888-229-8864. U.S. Bank and/or third-party vendors may change or terminate participating merchants; withdraw, limit, modify or cancel any rewards; or increase the number of FlexPoints required for any reward at any time without advance notice, even though such changes may affect the accrual or value of FlexPoints or rewards. For redemptions, information about the current Program Rewards Schedule, inquiries and updates, visit the Rewards Center anytime or call 888-229-8864 between 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. (CT) Monday through Friday, and between 8:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. (CT) Saturday through Sunday.
            Redeeming Points for your purchase results in a statement credit that offsets your Card purchases. For transactions which include a gratuity, fees or estimated taxes, the statement credit may not equal your final purchase amount. The credit to your Account statement will be processed within three business days and will appear on your next Account billing statement. Participating categories exclude gas stations, restaurants, and travel. Available only for transactions with U.S. merchants. The Account statement credit for a Real-Time Mobile Rewards redemption will reduce the Account balance, but will not count toward the minimum payment due. Standard data and messaging rates apply. Refer to the Program Rules for more information.
            U.S. Bank FlexPerks Travel Rewards Visa cardmembers may earn additional FlexPoints for purchases at merchants that are classified as: airlines, gas stations or grocery stores (each, a "Category"). You will earn FlexPoints at a rate of two FlexPoints for every $1 in Net Purchases in the one Category in any given monthly billing cycle that has the highest total of Net Purchases charged to your Account (the "Highest Category"). In addition, for any cellular services provider merchant, U.S. Bank FlexPerks Travel Rewards Visa cardmembers will be awarded FlexPoints at the rate of two FlexPoints for every $1 in Net Purchases during each billing cycle. U.S. Bank cannot control how merchants choose to classify their business and reserves the right to determine which Purchases will qualify. The U.S Bank FlexPerks Select Rewards Visa card is not eligible to earn double points on highest spend categories and at cell phone service providers.
            FlexPerks Travel Rewards Cardmembers may receive up to a $25 airline allowance with each redeemed airline award travel ticket. Cardmembers who redeem FlexPoints for award travel may be credited up to $25 on a future statement for Qualified Purchases made using their FlexPerks Travel Rewards Card with the airline carrier providing award travel flight. "Qualified Purchases" are any purchases made with your FlexPerks Travel Rewards Card that post to your account under the airline carrier providing your award travel flight between the dates of your award travel flight. Cardmembers must call Cardmember Services at 877.978.7446 to request a statement credit within 90 days of a Qualified Purchase. Once the request is approved by Cardmember Services, the Cardmember will receive a statement credit within 4 to 6 weeks for the amount of the qualified purchase, up to $25. U.S. Bank does not have the ability to control how a merchant chooses to classify their business and therefore reserves the right to determine which purchases qualify for allowance. You may redeem allowance for Qualified Purchases only if the outstanding balance of your account is below its revolve limit and if your account is open and in good standing under the terms of your Cardmember Agreement. Once you or we close your account for any reason, your allowance may be forfeited.
            You must be an eligible U.S. Bank FlexPerks Visa Signature Cardholder and register your Card at visa.gogoair.com/usbank to take advantage of the Gogo Inflight Wi-Fi benefit. Eligibility for this benefit is determined by U.S. Bank. In order to be eligible, you must have made at least one net purchase (purchase minus credits and returns) in the past 12 months prior to registering for the benefit, and Card cannot be past due or otherwise inactive. If your Card has been inactive and you make a purchase to qualify for the benefit, it may take 2–3 weeks to become eligible for the benefit. U.S. Bank FlexPerks Business Edge Cards are not eligible for this benefit. Provided you meet the eligibility requirements, your 12 complimentary Inflight Wi-Fi passes will be available to you at no additional cost after you complete the online registration. Each Inflight Wi-Fi pass provides for complimentary Inflight Wi-Fi Internet access for one device at a time on one flight segment on any participating airline's Gogo equipped flight between destinations within the United States and Canada where network coverage is available. Participating airlines are listed at https://promotions.gogoair.com/promotion/participating-airlines.html and are subject to change at any time without notice. Registration for this benefit is not available in flight — you must complete registration prior to your flight to access your Inflight Wi-Fi passes. If you have an existing subscription with Gogo, you will have to suspend or cancel the subscription before you can credit your Gogo account with the 12 Inflight Wi-Fi passes. To suspend or cancel your subscription, simply chat with Gogo via Live Help, email Gogo at CustomerCare@gogoair.com or call Gogo at 877-350-0038. Each Inflight Wi-Fi pass may be redeemed on any Wi-Fi enabled laptop, tablet, or smartphone for Inflight Wi-Fi Internet access on one (1) flight segment (a segment is defined as a takeoff and a landing). Inflight Wi-Fi passes are valid for 12 months from the date that you register your Card for the Gogo Inflight Wi-Fi benefit. Any unused Inflight Wi-Fi passes will expire at the end of the 12-month period. At the end of your initial 12-month period, provided the Gogo Inflight Wi-Fi benefit is still being offered and you continue to meet U.S. Bank’s eligibility requirements, you will receive an email inviting you to reregister for the benefit at visa.gogoair.com/usbank to receive another 12 Inflight Wi-Fi passes.
