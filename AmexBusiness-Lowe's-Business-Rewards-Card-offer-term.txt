How We Will Calculate Your Balance: We use a method called "average daily balance (including new purchases.)"Loss of Introductory APR: We may end your Introductory APR and apply the Penalty APR if you do not pay at least the Minimum Payment Due within 60 days after its Payment Due Date. The variable penalty APR will not exceed 29.99%.Variable APRs for each billing period are based on the Prime Rate published in The Wall Street Journal on the Closing Date of the billing period. The Wall Street Journal may not publish the Prime Rate on that day. If it does not, we will use the Prime Rate from the previous day it was published. If the Prime Rate increases, variable APRs will increase. In that case, you may pay more interest and have a higher Minimum Payment Due. When the Prime Rate changes, the resulting changes to variable APRs take effect as of the first day of the billing period. Variable APRs are accurate as of 3/22/2018.

Lowe's Business Rewards Redemption OptionsThe American Express® Gift Card, the Gas Rewards Card, and Outdoor Rewards Card can be used at U.S merchants that accept American Express® Cards. No ATM cash withdrawal. Some limitations apply, including restrictions on use at cruise lines or for recurring billing. See Cardholder Agreements for complete details. Cards cannot be redeemed for cash except where required by law. Cards are issued by American Express Prepaid Card Management Corporations.When using your Card to pay for gasoline, we recommend you prepay inside the station rather than paying for gasoline at the pump. However, if you pay for gasoline at the pump please note many pumps seek a preauthorization before allowing you to use the Card which could be up to $75 or more. This is called a "Preauthorization Request". If you have insufficient funds on your Card to cover the "Preauthorization Request", the Card may be declined. When a merchant submits this Preauthorization Request, we will hold the amount of the Preauthorization Request until the final transaction is cleared. If the total cost of your gasoline purchase is less than the Preauthorization Request, we will release the difference between the total gasoline purchase and the Preauthorization Request, typically within 8 business days. During the period when funds are temporarily held, funds will not be available for use.

Lowe's Business Rewards Redemption OptionsThe American Express® Gift Card, the Gas Rewards Card, and Outdoor Rewards Card can be used at U.S merchants that accept American Express® Cards. No ATM cash withdrawal. Some limitations apply, including restrictions on use at cruise lines or for recurring billing. See Cardholder Agreements for complete details. Cards cannot be redeemed for cash except where required by law. Cards are issued by American Express Prepaid Card Management Corporations.When using your Card to pay for gasoline, we recommend you prepay inside the station rather than paying for gasoline at the pump. However, if you pay for gasoline at the pump please note many pumps seek a preauthorization before allowing you to use the Card which could be up to $75 or more. This is called a "Preauthorization Request". If you have insufficient funds on your Card to cover the "Preauthorization Request", the Card may be declined. When a merchant submits this Preauthorization Request, we will hold the amount of the Preauthorization Request until the final transaction is cleared. If the total cost of your gasoline purchase is less than the Preauthorization Request, we will release the difference between the total gasoline purchase and the Preauthorization Request, typically within 8 business days. During the period when funds are temporarily held, funds will not be available for use.
