Balance Transfer Option
Balance transfers are contingent upon issuance of your account with us.
The total amount of your request(s) including fees and interest charges cannot exceed your available credit or $15,000, whichever is lower.
We will not process any balance transfer requests that are from any other account or loan that we (Chase Bank USA, N.A.) or any of our affiliates issued.
Balance transfers are subject to the transaction fee shown in the enclosed "Pricing Information."
We will evaluate your balance transfer requests in the order listed on your response. If your request(s) exceeds the amount that we approve, we may either decline the request or send less than the full amount requested to your designated payee.
Each transfer will reduce your available credit just like any other transaction. You will see a payment for the amount transferred on the statement from your other accounts. It may take up to three weeks to set up your new account with us and process the balance transfer(s), so you may still need to make payments to your other accounts to keep them current.
