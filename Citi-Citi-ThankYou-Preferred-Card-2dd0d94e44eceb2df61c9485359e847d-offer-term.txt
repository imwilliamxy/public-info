If we give you the option to transfer a balance with your application, it will take at least 14 days after your Card Account is opened to process any balance transfer payments. During this time, you may cancel or modify your balance transfer request by calling the number on the back of your card.
You may transfer any amount, but the total amount of your balance transfer plus balance transfer fees must be less than your available revolving credit limit. Be sure you don't transfer any disputed purchase or other charge amount because you may lose your dispute rights. You cannot transfer balances from other accounts issued by Citi or its affiliates.

The available revolving credit limit for your new card will be reduced by the total amount of the transfers, including fees we approve.

Citi® ThankYou® Rewards
Summary of the Citi ThankYou® Preferred Card Terms and ConditionsWith the Card Account, you can earn ThankYou Points for purchases made on your card.
 
Unless you are participating in a limited-time offer, you will earn:--2 ThankYou Points for each $1 spent on purchases at restaurants (including cafes, bars, lounges and fast food restaurants), and on select entertainment, including live entertainment, live theatrical productions, concerts, live sporting events, movie theaters, amusement parks (including zoos, aquariums, circuses and carnivals), tourist attractions (including museums, and art galleries), record stores, video rental stores and on-demand internet streaming media;
Certain Non-Qualifying Purchases. You won't earn 2X Points for purchases made at bakeries, certain restaurants/cafes inside department, grocery or warehouse stores, sporting camps, public and private golf courses, country clubs (including membership fees), stores that sell musical instruments, video game arcades, bowling alleys, stores that primarily sell video games/accessories, charitable organizations that provide live entertainment, bookstores, and sports complexes where you participate in the sport.
-- 1 ThankYou Point for each $1 spent on other purchases including the non-qualifying purchases listed above.
Only Purchases Earn Points. Balance transfers, cash advances, checks that access your card account, items returned for credit, unauthorized charges, interest and account fees, travelers checks, foreign currency purchases, money orders, wire transfers (and similar cash-like transactions), lottery tickets, gaming chips (and similar betting transactions) do not earn ThankYou Points.
Each merchant - e.g., a retailer, business or any other place where you can make a purchase - is assigned a code that indicates the merchant's primary area of business. We don't assign or have any control over merchant codes. Codes are chosen and assigned by a third party, who may change the codes from time to time. When you make a purchase at a merchant, we're provided the code for that merchant and if the code matches a category that gives you additional points, you will earn the additional points. Because we don't control what code a merchant is assigned, sometimes a purchase that you think fits a certain category may not earn additional points. For example, a restaurant located within a large retail outlet may not be assigned a "restaurant" code, but rather a "retailer" code. This means that if you receive additional points for "dining out," you won't earn additional points for purchases at that restaurant. Or a restaurant located within a hotel may not be assigned a "restaurant" code, but rather a "hotel" code. This means that if you receive more points for purchases at a hotel than you receive for purchases at a restaurant, each purchase at that restaurant will be treated as a purchase at a hotel, and you'll receive additional Points. Please see our FAQs at thankyou.com/help or call the ThankYou Service Center at 1-800-THANKYOU (1-800-842-6596) for more information about merchant codes and categories.
You may earn ThankYou Points as long as your Card Account is open and current.

If ThankYou Rewards is terminated, you will have 90 days from ThankYou Rewards termination date to redeem all your accumulated ThankYou Points. The ThankYou Rewards program may be changed at any time. Rewards offered by ThankYou Rewards and the ThankYou Point levels required for specific rewards are subject to change without notice.ThankYou Points earned from purchases post to your Card Account at the close of each billing cycle, and at that time we will transfer the ThankYou Points you earned to your ThankYou Member Account.
