                       Certain Non-Qualifying Purchases. You will only earn 1%, 
not 3%, for purchases made at bakeries and certain restaurants/cafes inside depa
rtment stores, grocery or warehouse clubs.                                      
                                  2% cash back on all other purchases from Costc
o and Costco.com.                                                    1% cash bac
k on all other purchases, including the non-qualifying purchases listed above.  
                                      Merchant Classification: Each merchant - t
hat is a retailer, business or any other place where you can make a purchase - i
s assigned a code that indicates the merchant's area of business. For example, r
estaurants are generally assigned a specific merchant code. We don't assign or h
ave any control over merchant codes. Codes are chosen and assigned by a third pa
rty, who may change the codes from time to time. When you make a purchase at a m
erchant, we're provided the code for that merchant. If the code matches a catego
ry that gives you additional Costco Cash Rewards - for example, if the merchant 
code tells us that you made a purchase at a restaurant - we'll give you the addi
tional Costco Cash Rewards for that purchase. Because we don't control what code
 a merchant is assigned, sometimes a purchase that you think fits a certain cate
gory may not earn additional Costco Cash Rewards. For example, a restaurant loca
ted within a large retail outlet may not be assigned a "restaurant" code, but ra
ther a "retailer" code. This means that even though you receive additional Costc
o Cash Rewards for purchases at "restaurants," you won't earn additional Costco 
Cash Rewards for purchases at that restaurant.            What doesn't qualify a
s a purchase?: The following types of transactions don't qualify as purchases th
at earn Costco Cash Rewards:                            Use of checks that acces
s your Card Account                Balance transfers                Cash advance
s                                    Travelers checks, foreign currency purchase
s, money orders, wire transfers and similar cash-like transactions              
                  Lottery tickets, gaming chips and similar betting transactions
                Interest and account fees                Unauthorized charges   
             Items returned for credit                        Returns: Returned 
items may result in credits being applied to your Card Account which will reduce
 or may eliminate accumulated Costco Cash Rewards and may result in a negative c
ash rewards balance. If your Card Account has a negative Costco Cash Rewards bal
ance, any newly earned Costco Cash Rewards will be used to offset such negative 
Costco Cash Rewards balance until such balance has been brought to zero.        
    You must maintain your Costco Membership to receive and redeem your Costco C
ash Rewards.            Redeeming Costco Cash Rewards: Your reward is distribute
d annually, in the form of a credit card reward certificate, once your February 
billing statement closes, and is redeemable through December 31 of the year issu
ed in a single transaction at any U.S. Costco warehouse, including in Puerto Ric
o, for merchandise or cash back. The credit card reward certificate will contain
 your Costco Cash Rewards balance based on your eligible purchases during the an
nual reward period. The annual reward period is based on January through Decembe
r billing statements. Should you choose to redeem only a portion of the certific
ate for merchandise, you will receive the remaining balance in cash at the Costc
o warehouse register upon checkout. Some warehouses may not permit the credit ca
rd reward certificate to be redeemed for alcohol purchases. Requests for cash ma
y be fulfilled in the form of a check at  Costco's  discretion. Your credit card
 reward certificate must be redeemed in person on or prior to its expiration dat
e of December 31 in the year in which it is issued. Any Costco Cash Rewards you 
have earned on purchases made by authorized users on your Card Account will be a
dded to your Costco Cash Rewards total. Only you, the primary cardmember, are el
igible to receive the annual credit card reward certificate; however, you or any
one you authorize may redeem the certificate. You will not receive a credit card
 reward certificate if your reward is less than $1 or your account is closed at 
the time your credit card reward certificate is scheduled to be sent; any Costco
 Cash Rewards that had been accrued at that time will be forfeited. You must mai
ntain your Costco Membership to redeem your credit card reward certificate.     
       Account Closure: If we close your Card Account, you will no longer be abl
e to earn Costco Cash Rewards, and you will forfeit any Costco Cash Rewards accu
mulated, but not yet distributed. If you close or convert your Card Account prio
r to receiving the credit card reward certificate in your February billing state
ment, any earned Costco Cash Rewards will be forfeited.            Forfeiture: A
ll Costco Cash Rewards not disbursed via an annual credit card reward certificat
e due to the reward amount being less than $1, the account status (including acc
ount closure), or other reasons, will be forfeited. Additionally, any Costco Cas
h Rewards not redeemed by December 31 of the year of issuance of the credit card
 reward certificate will be forfeited.            Value of Costco Cash Rewards: 
Costco Cash Rewards have no cash value until such time as they are redeemed at a
 Costco warehouse.            Property Rights: You have no property rights or ot
her legal interests in Costco Cash Rewards. Costco Cash Rewards may not be trans
ferred to any other person including through such events as inheritance, bankrup
tcy or divorce. Costco Cash Rewards cannot be assigned or pledged.            Ch

ctivity, we will investigate and, if we determine that fraud, misuse or abuse ha
