How you can earn Avios points: You'll earn Avios points when you, or an authorized user, use an Iberia credit card to make purchases of products and services, minus returns or refunds. Buying products and services with your card, in most cases, will count as a purchase; however, the following types of transactions won't count as a purchase and won't earn Avios points: balance transfers, cash advances and other cash-like transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting transactions, any checks that access your account, interest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if applicable. 4 Avios points on up to $30,000 in purchases your first year: You'll earn 4 Avios points for each $1 spent on purchases for your first 12 months from account opening, or until you reach $30,000 in purchases, whichever occurs first. This is an additional 1 Avios point on top of the 3 Avios points earned on flight purchases made directly with Iberia, British Airways, LEVEL, and Aer Lingus, and 3 additional Avios points for each $1 spent on all other purchases. After that, you'll earn 3 Avios points: You'll earn 3 Avios points for each $1 spent on flight purchases made directly with Iberia, British Airways, LEVEL, and Aer Lingus. 1 Avios point: You'll earn 1 Avios point for each $1 spent on all other purchases. Information about earning/transferring Avios points to Iberia: Avios points earned during a billing cycle will be automatically transferred to Iberia after the end of each billing cycle. Avios points expiration: Avios points will expire according to the Iberia Plus Program Terms and Conditions which include maintaining Iberia Plus program activity for 36 consecutive months. Losing Avios points: You'll immediately lose all Avios points that haven't been transferred to Iberia if your Iberia credit card account status changes, or your Iberia credit card account is closed for program misuse, fraudulent activities, failure to pay, bankruptcy, or other reasons described in the terms of the Rewards Program Agreement.                                                                                            $1,000 Discount Voucher                                                                        Subject to Iberia flight availability.
