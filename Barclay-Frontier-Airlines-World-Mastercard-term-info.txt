ver Card account that you want us to process a balance transfer from. If the tot
al amount you request exceeds the assigned credit line on your new account, we m
ay either decline the request or send a partial payment to your creditor(s). The
 amount of available credit on your new account will be reduced by the amount tr
ansferred and the related balance transfer fees. We reserve the right to decline
 to process any requested balance transfer. We will not process a request to tra
nsfer a balance from any other account you may have with us. Balance transfers i
ncur interest from the transaction date. You should not transfer the amount of a
ny disputed purchase or other charge. If you do, you may lose your dispute right
s.Upon approval of your application we will process the requested balance transf
er payment to the account(s) which you have requested on the 10th day after we'v

ransfer may take up to 4 weeks to post to your other accounts. Continue to pay e

. If you would like to complete a balance transfer from another account that is 
not a Visa, Mastercard, American Express or Discover Card account, please call t
he phone number on the back of your new credit card once you are approved. Balan
ce transfers are subject to availability. We may deny balance transfer requests

ement balance minus any new 0% introductory APR Balance Transfer balances. To av
oid a late fee, you should pay at least the minimum payment due on your account
