s: To request a balance transfer please enter the 15/16 digit account number fro
m the Mastercard, Visa, American Express, or Discover Card account that you want
 us to process a balance transfer from. If the total amount you request exceeds 
the assigned credit line on your new account, we may either decline the request 
or send a partial payment to your creditor(s). The amount of available credit on
 your new account will be reduced by the amount transferred and the related bala
nce transfer fees. We reserve the right to decline to process any requested bala
nce transfer. We will not process a request to transfer a balance from any other
 account you may have with us. Balance transfers incur interest from the transac
tion date. You should not transfer the amount of any disputed purchase or other 
charge. If you do, you may lose your dispute rights.Upon approval of your applic
ation we will process the requested balance transfer payment to the account(s) w
hich you have requested on the 10th day after we've mailed you your card; during
 this 10 day time period you may cancel your balance transfer by contacting us a
t the number on the back of your card. A balance transfer may take up to 4 weeks
 to post to your other accounts. Continue to pay each creditor until the balance
 transfer appears on the other account as a credit. If you would like to complet
e a balance transfer from another account that is not a Visa, Mastercard, Americ
an Express or Discover Card account, please call the phone number on the back of
 your new credit card once you are approved. Balance transfers are subject to av
ailability. We may deny balance transfer requests at any time and for any reason
.Avoiding Interest on Purchases: We will not charge you interest on any purchase
s if you pay your entire balance by the due date each month. In addition, during
 this introductory period we will not charge you interest on purchases if you pa
y by the due date each month your outstanding statement balance minus any new 0%
 introductory APR Balance Transfer balances. To avoid a late fee, you should pay
 at least the minimum payment due on your account each month.Credit Limit: We do
 not permit applicants to request a specific credit limit. We do not consider a 
request for a balance transfer made with an application to be a request for a pa
rticular credit limit. We determine the credit limit on your account independent
 of and prior to processing any balance transfer request.Cash Equivalent Purchas
es: The purchase of money orders, travelers' checks, foreign currency, lottery t
ickets, gambling chips, wire transfers and other similar transactions are treate
