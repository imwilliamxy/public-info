Cash Back and Points: "Cash Back rewards" are the rewards you earn under the program. Cash Back rewards are tracked as points and each $1 in Cash Back rewards earned is equal to 100 points. You may simply see "Cash Back" in marketing materials when referring to the rewards you earn. How you can earn points: You'll earn points when you, or an authorized user, use a Chase Freedom Unlimited card to make purchases of products and services, minus returns or refunds. Buying products and services with your card, in most cases, will count as a purchase; however, the following types of transactions won't count and won't earn points: balance transfers, cash advances and other cash-like transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting transactions, any checks that access your account, interest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if applicable.  
          3.5% Cash Back on qualifying Lyft rides through 03/2022: You'll earn 3.5% Cash Back for each $1 spent when your card is used for qualifying Lyft products and services purchased through the Lyft mobile application through 03/31/2022. Qualifying Lyft products and services include rides taken in Classic, Shared, Lux, or XL modes; bike and scooter rides; and subscription and membership products. Purchase of gift cards, car rentals, vehicle service centers, miscellaneous fees, and other Lyft products and services are excluded from this promotion. Future Lyft products or services may not be eligible for additional Cash Back. You may see "5% Cash Back rewards" in marketing materials to refer to the 3.5% Cash Back rewards earned in addition to the 1.5% Cash Back rewards earned on all purchases. The additional 3.5% Cash Back rewards will appear on your billing statement in a separate line from the 1.5% Cash Back rewards.
          How you can use your points: You can use your points to redeem for any available reward options, including cash, gift cards, travel, and products or services made available through the program or directly from third party merchants. Redemption values for reward options vary. Points expiration/losing points: Your points don't expire as long as your account remains open, however, you will immediately lose all your points if your account status changes, or your account is closed for program misuse, fraudulent activities, failure to pay, bankruptcy, or other reasons described in the terms of the Rewards Program Agreement.
