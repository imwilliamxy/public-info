                                Rewards Program Agreement: For more information 
about the Ink Business Preferred rewards program, view the latest Rewards Progra
m Agreement. We will mail your Rewards Program Agreement once your account is es
tablished. If you become a Chase Online customer, your Rewards Program Agreement
 will also be available after logging in to chase.com/ultimaterewards.        Ho
w you can earn points: You'll earn points when you, or an authorized user, use a
n Ink Business PreferredSM card to make purchases of products and services, minu
s returns or refunds. Buying products and services with your card, in most cases
, will count as a purchase; however, the following types of transactions won't c
ount and won't earn points: balance transfers, cash advances and other cash-like
 transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or simila
r betting transactions, any checks that access your account, interest, unauthori
zed or fraudulent charges, and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if app
licable. 1 point: You'll earn 1 point for each $1 spent. 3 points ("3X points"):
 You'll earn 3 points total for each $1 of the first $150,000 spent each account
 anniversary year on combined purchases in the following rewards categories: shi
pping; advertising purchases made with social media sites and search engines; tr
avel; internet, cable, and phone services (two additional points on top of the 1
 point per $1 earned on each purchase). After $150,000 is spent on combined purc
hases in these categories each account anniversary year, you go back to earning 
1 point for every dollar spent, with no maximum. How you can use your points: Yo
u can use your points to redeem for any available reward options, including cash
, gift cards, travel, and products or services made available through the progra
m or directly from third party merchants. Redemption values for reward options v
ary. Points expiration/losing points: Your points don't expire as long as your a
ccount remains open, however, you will immediately lose all your points if your 
account status changes, or your account is closed for program misuse, fraudulent
 activities, failure to pay, bankruptcy, or other reasons described in the terms
 of the Rewards Program Agreement. Rewards Categories: Merchants who accept Visa
/MasterCard credit cards are assigned a merchant code, which is determined by th
e merchant or its processor in accordance with Visa/MasterCard procedures based 
on the kinds of products and services they primarily sell. We group similar merc
hant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers to you. Please 
note: We make every effort to include all relevant merchant codes in our rewards
 categories. However, even though a merchant or some of the items that it sells 
may appear to fit within a rewards category, the merchant may not have a merchan
t code in that category. When this occurs, purchases with that merchant won't qu
alify for rewards offers on purchases in that category. Purchases submitted by y
ou, an authorized user, or the merchant through third-party payment accounts, mo
bile or wireless card readers, online or mobile digital wallets, or similar tech
nology will not qualify in a rewards category if the technology is not set up to
 process the purchase in that rewards category. For more information about Chase
 rewards categories, see www.Chase.com/RewardsCategoryFAQs.                     
                                                                       Points Ar
e Worth 25% More                                                                
        When you use points to redeem for cash, each point is worth $.01 (one ce
nt), which means that 100 points equals $1 in redemption value. Each point you r
edeem for travel booked through Chase Ultimate Rewards is worth $.0125 (one and 
a quarter cents), which means that 100 points equals $1.25 in redemption value, 
and points are worth 25% more than if redeemed for cash. For example, 80,000 poi
nts are worth $1,000 towards travel, or $800 when redeemed for cash. The cost of
 travel is based on the rates and fares available through the Ultimate Rewards w
ebsite and travel center, and may not reflect all rates and fares that are avail
able through other sales channels.
