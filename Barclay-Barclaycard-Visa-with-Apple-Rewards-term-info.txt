es for Opening a New Account: To help the government fight the funding of terror
ism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institut
ions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who o
pens an account. What this means to you: When you apply for an account, we will 
ask for your name, street address, date of birth, social security number, and ot
her information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see copie
s of identifying documents. We also ask for country of citizenship.Balance Trans
fers. Here's How it Works: To request a balance transfer please enter the 15/16 
digit account number from the Mastercard, Visa, American Express, or Discover Ca
rd account that you want us to process a balance transfer from. If the total amo
unt you request exceeds the assigned credit line on your new account, we may eit
her decline the request or send a partial payment to your creditor(s). The amoun
t of available credit on your new account will be reduced by the amount transfer
red and the related balance transfer fees. We reserve the right to decline to pr
ocess any requested balance transfer. We will not process a request to transfer 
a balance from any other account you may have with us. Balance transfers incur i
nterest from the transaction date. You should not transfer the amount of any dis
puted purchase or other charge. If you do, you may lose your dispute rights.Upon
 approval of your application we will process the requested balance transfer pay
ment to the account(s) which you have requested on the 10th day after we've mail
ed you your card; during this 10 day time period you may cancel your balance tra
nsfer by contacting us at the number on the back of your card. A balance transfe
r may take up to 4 weeks to post to your other accounts. Continue to pay each cr
editor until the balance transfer appears on the other account as a credit. If y
ou would like to complete a balance transfer from another account that is not a 
Visa, Mastercard, American Express or Discover Card account, please call the pho
ne number on the back of your new credit card once you are approved. Balance tra
nsfers are subject to availability. We may deny balance transfer requests at any
 time and for any reason.Credit Limit: We do not permit applicants to request a 
specific credit limit. We do not consider a request for a balance transfer made 
with an application to be a request for a particular credit limit. We determine 
the credit limit on your account independent of and prior to processing any bala
nce transfer request.Cash Equivalent Purchases: The purchase of money orders, tr
avelers' checks, foreign currency, lottery tickets, gambling chips, wire transfe
rs and other similar transactions are treated as cash advances. Please see your 
Cardmember Agreement for details.New York Residents: New York residents may cont
act the New York State Department of Financial Services by telephone (800) 342-3
