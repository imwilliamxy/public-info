  Points are earned on net  purchases only (purchases less returns and credits). PIN-based and ATM  transactions do not earn Points. For each $1 spent, earn 3 Points on net  purchases made at merchants that classify their merchant location for Visa in  any of the following categories: airlines, hotels, taxis, limousines, rental  cars, trains, buses, gasoline stations, groceries, restaurants, fast food and  takeout food dining establishments, and 1 Point on all other net purchases. We  do not determine whether merchants correctly identify and bill transactions as  being made at locations in each particular category. However, we do reserve the  right to determine which purchases qualify for the 3 Points on category  purchases. Purchases not eligible to receive the 3 Points on category purchases  include, but are not limited to, purchases made at superstores, warehouse  clubs, discount stores and their affiliates, and they will instead receive 1  Point. Online and catalog purchases are not eligible to receive the 3 Points on  category purchases, and they will instead receive 1 Point, unless the merchants  have correctly identified and billed the transactions. See the City National  Rewards Program Terms, Conditions and Program Rules and FAQs for details.
  Statement credit is  provided under the Airline Incidental Fees Statement Credit benefit and is  limited to Qualifying Airline Purchases made at eligible U.S.-Domestic Airline  Carriers. Qualifying Airline Purchases must be charged to a Crystal Visa  Infinite Credit Card to be eligible for a statement credit. Qualifying Airline  Purchases are defined as incidental airline fee transactions made at eligible U.S.-Domestic  Airline Carriers and include: ticket change/cancellation fees, checked baggage  fees, inflight entertainment, onboard food and beverage charges, airport lounge  membership fees and day passes, onboard wireless charges (excluding Gogo Inflight  Wi-Fi), and TSA Pre✓ membership application fee. Qualifying Airline Purchases may vary by airline.  Merchants are responsible for correctly identifying the transactions under the  appropriate codes or identifiers on Visa's proprietary network. City National  Bank and Visa rely on the merchant to submit the correct information for the  transaction. Additional conditions, limitations and exclusions apply. The  Airline Incidental Fees Statement Credit benefit is subject to change and  cancellation at any time. This benefit may be subject to taxation and Form 1099  reporting. Taxes, if any, are the responsibility of the Crystal Visa Infinite  Credit Cardholder.

    TSA Pre✓ is a  U.S. Government program operated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security  ("DHS") through the Transportation Security Administration  ("TSA") service.
