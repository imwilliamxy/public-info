<h2>Balance Transfer Information</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="font-bold">How to Make Balance Transfers</span>
            </p>

            <ul class="numbered-list">
                <li>
                   After receiving your card, you can call the customer service number on the back of your card to transfer balances. Balance transfers are made available at our discretion. All balance transfers are subject to the standard purchase APR unless an introductory and/or other promotional rate applies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If we give you the option to transfer a balance with your application, it will take at least 14 days after your Card Account is opened to process any balance transfer payments. During this time, you may cancel or modify your balance transfer request by calling the number on the back of your card.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You may transfer any amount, but the total amount of your balance transfer plus balance transfer fees must be less than your available credit limit. Be sure you don't transfer any disputed purchase or other charge amount because you may lose your dispute rights. You cannot transfer balances from other accounts issued by Citi or its affiliates. If you are unsure of the issuer on the account, please visit <a href="https://www.citi.com/affiliatesproducts" target="_blank">www.citi.com/affiliatesproducts</a> for a list of Citi products and affiliates.</li>
<li>Continue to make payments on your other accounts until you have confirmed this balance transfer has been received. Once approved, we'll pay the amount of the balance transfer directly to that issuer. The available credit limit for your new card will be reduced by the total amount of the transfers, including fees we approve.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><span class="font-bold">Things You Should Know About Your Balance Transfer Offer:</span></p>

   <p>If you transfer a balance with this offer, interest will be charged on purchases made with your credit card unless your purchases have a 0% APR or you pay the New Balance shown on your statement (including the amount of your balance transfer) in full by the payment due date each billing period.</p>
<p>If you default under your Card Agreement you may lose any promotional APR on the balance transfer.</p>

            <h2>Costco Cash Rewards Program Terms</h2>

            <p> 
                Your Card Account will earn Costco Cash Rewards based on your purchases that can be redeemed for merchandise or cash back at any U.S. Costco warehouse, including Puerto Rico ("Costco Cash Rewards"). 
            </p>    

            <p><span class="font-bold">Earning Costco Cash Rewards on Purchases:</span> You'll earn Costco Cash Rewards for purchases using your Card Account, minus returns and refunds, as follows:</p>


            <ul>
                <li>4% cash back on eligible gas worldwide, including gas at  Costco, for the first $7,000 per year in gas purchases and then 1% thereafter.
                    <ul class="oddDotList">
                        <li><span class="font-bold">Certain Non-Qualifying Purchases.</span> You will only earn 1% cash back, not 4%, for gas purchased at superstores, supermarkets, convenience stores and warehouse clubs other than Costco or for fuel used for non-automobile purposes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    3% cash back on restaurant (including cafes, bars, lounges  and fast food restaurants) and eligible travel purchases worldwide, including airfare, hotels, car rentals, travel  agencies, cruise lines and Costco Travel.
                    <ul class="oddDotList">
                        <li><span class="font-bold">Certain Non-Qualifying Purchases.</span> You will only earn 1%, not 3%, for purchases made at bakeries and certain restaurants/cafes inside department stores, grocery or warehouse clubs.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    2% cash back on all other purchases from Costco and <a href="#" class="ddLink" onclick="window.open('/cards/credit/application/View.action?docId=LeavingSiteSpeedBump&amp;langId=EN&amp;speedbump=Y&amp;SI=4','popup','width=650,height=400,resizable,scrollbars')">Costco.com</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    1% cash back on all other purchases, including the non-qualifying purchases listed above.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><span class="font-bold">Merchant Classification:</span> Each merchant - that is a retailer, business or any other place where you can make a purchase - is assigned a code that indicates the merchant's area of business. For example, restaurants are generally assigned a specific merchant code. We don't assign or have any control over merchant codes. Codes are chosen and assigned by a third party, who may change the codes from time to time. When you make a purchase at a merchant, we're provided the code for that merchant. If the code matches a category that gives you additional Costco Cash Rewards - for example, if the merchant code tells us that you made a purchase at a restaurant - we'll give you the additional Costco Cash Rewards for that purchase. Because we don't control what code a merchant is assigned, sometimes a purchase that you think fits a certain category may not earn additional Costco Cash Rewards. For example, a restaurant located within a large retail outlet may not be assigned a "restaurant" code, but rather a "retailer" code. This means that even though you receive additional Costco Cash Rewards for purchases at "restaurants," you won't earn additional Costco Cash Rewards for purchases at that restaurant.</p>

            <p><span class="font-bold">What doesn't qualify as a purchase?:</span> The following types of transactions don't qualify as purchases that earn Costco Cash Rewards:</p>

            <ul type="circle">
                <li>Use of checks that access your Card Account</li>
                <li>Balance transfers</li>
                <li>Cash advances</li>
                <li>
                    Travelers checks, foreign currency purchases, money orders, wire transfers and similar cash-like transactions
                </li>
                <li>Lottery tickets, gaming chips and similar betting transactions</li>
                <li>Interest and account fees</li>
                <li>Unauthorized charges</li>
                <li>Items returned for credit</li>
            </ul>

            <p><span class="font-bold">Returns:</span> Returned items may result in credits being applied to your Card Account which will reduce or may eliminate accumulated Costco Cash Rewards and may result in a negative cash rewards balance. If your Card Account has a negative Costco Cash Rewards balance, any newly earned Costco Cash Rewards will be used to offset such negative Costco Cash Rewards balance until such balance has been brought to zero.</p>

            <p>You must maintain your Costco Membership to receive and redeem your Costco Cash Rewards.</p>

            <p><span class="font-bold">Redeeming Costco Cash Rewards:</span> Your reward is distributed annually, in the form of a credit card reward certificate, once your February billing statement closes, and is redeemable through December 31 of the year issued in a single transaction at any U.S. Costco warehouse, including in Puerto Rico, for merchandise or cash back. The credit card reward certificate will contain your Costco Cash Rewards balance based on your eligible purchases during the annual reward period. The annual reward period is based on January through December billing statements. Should you choose to redeem only a portion of the certificate for merchandise, you will receive the remaining balance in cash at the Costco warehouse register upon checkout. Some warehouses may not permit the credit card reward certificate to be redeemed for alcohol purchases. Requests for cash may be fulfilled in the form of a check at  Costco's  discretion. Your credit card reward certificate must be redeemed in person on or prior to its expiration date of December 31 in the year in which it is issued. Any Costco Cash Rewards you have earned on purchases made by authorized users on your Card Account will be added to your Costco Cash Rewards total. Only you, the primary cardmember, are eligible to receive the annual credit card reward certificate; however, you or anyone you authorize may redeem the certificate. <span class="font-bold">You will not receive a credit card reward certificate if your reward is less than $1 or your account is closed at the time your credit card reward certificate is scheduled to be sent; any Costco Cash Rewards that had been accrued at that time will be forfeited. You must maintain your Costco Membership to redeem your credit card reward certificate.</span></p>

            <p><span class="font-bold">Account Closure:</span> If we close your Card Account, you will no longer be able to earn Costco Cash Rewards, and you will forfeit any Costco Cash Rewards accumulated, but not yet distributed. If you close or convert your Card Account prior to receiving the credit card reward certificate in your February billing statement, any earned Costco Cash Rewards will be forfeited.</p>

            <p><span class="font-bold">Forfeiture:</span> All Costco Cash Rewards not disbursed via an annual credit card reward certificate due to the reward amount being less than $1, the account status (including account closure), or other reasons, will be forfeited. Additionally, any Costco Cash Rewards not redeemed by December 31 of the year of issuance of the credit card reward certificate will be forfeited.</p>
            <p><span class="font-bold">Value of Costco Cash Rewards:</span> Costco Cash Rewards have no cash value until such time as they are redeemed at a Costco warehouse.</p>

            <p><span class="font-bold">Property Rights:</span> You have no property rights or other legal interests in Costco Cash Rewards. Costco Cash Rewards may not be transferred to any other person including through such events as inheritance, bankruptcy or divorce. Costco Cash Rewards cannot be assigned or pledged.</p>

            <p><span class="font-bold">Changes to Program Rules:</span> We may make changes to the Costco Cash Rewards Program at any time without notice. We will give you 30 days' written notice if we make any of the following changes: a change that negatively affects the number of Costco Cash Rewards you can earn, a change that negatively affects how/when you may lose your Costco Cash Rewards, a change that negatively affects how you can exercise your rights with respect to Costco Cash Rewards, or if we cancel the program.</p>

            <p><span class="font-bold">Fraud:</span> If we see evidence of fraud, misuse, abuse, or suspicious activity, we will investigate and, if we determine that fraud, misuse or abuse has occurred, we may take actions against you. These actions may include, without limitation:</p>

            <ul type="circle">
                <li>Taking away the Costco Cash Rewards you earned because of fraud, misuse or abuse</li>
                <li>Preventing you from earning Costco Cash Rewards</li>
                <li>Suspending or closing your Costco Cash Rewards Account</li>
                <li>Taking legal action to recover Costco Cash Rewards redeemed because of such activity and to recover our monetary losses, including litigation costs and damages</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Some examples of fraud, misuse, abuse and suspicious activity include:</p>

            <ul type="circle">
                
                <li>Using your Card Account in an abusive manner for the primary purpose of acquiring Costco Cash Rewards </li>
                <li>Using your Consumer Card Account other than primarily for personal, consumer or household purposes</li> 
                    
            </ul>
