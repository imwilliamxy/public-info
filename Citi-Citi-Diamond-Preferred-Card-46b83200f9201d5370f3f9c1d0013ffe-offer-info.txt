                  Verified BuyerVerified BuyerVerified BuyerThis is by far the worst credit card I ever had over the last 25 years of my credit history. I make my payments on time, usually over minimum payment, yet my minimum payment goes up considerable when I don't "max" out my card for the month. When I call, customer service reads from a script and tells me it the variable interest rate. I have variable interest rates on all my cards, and they NEVER increase my minimum payment more than $50 when my balance goes DOWN. It seems I'm being penalized for not using the card because I'm trying to pay it off. It may not seem like a lot of money to some people, but $50 to a teacher is A LOT of money a month and really messes up my budget.More DetailsWhich benefit do you enjoy the most?No Annual FeesCustomer Service1Rated 1 out of 5 starsOnline Account Access3Rated 3 out of 5 starsBottom Line No, I would not recommend to a friend Was this review helpful to you?00Flag this review5Rated 5 out of 5 starsCiti Has Me in the Long RunSubmitted  3 months ago

                  Verified BuyerVerified BuyerVerified BuyerCiti ensures that you will be paying for life, due to one mistake. Thought it was great until I lost my job and couldn't pay off 2 cards at once.   Have deal with them to pay off one at a low amount, so they are raising the minimum on the remaining card to get more out of me.  Will never return to Citi again.More DetailsCustomer Service1Rated 1 out of 5 starsOnline Account Access3Rated 3 out of 5 starsBottom Line No, I would not recommend to a friend Was this review helpful to you?00Flag this review5Rated 5 out of 5 starssmartshopSubmitted  4 months ago
