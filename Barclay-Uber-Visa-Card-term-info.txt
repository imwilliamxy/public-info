ce Transfers. Here's How it Works: To request a balance transfer please enter th
e 15/16 digit account number from the Mastercard, Visa, American Express, or Dis
cover Card account that you want us to process a balance transfer from. If the t
otal amount you request exceeds the assigned credit line on your new account, we
 may either decline the request or send a partial payment to your creditor(s). T
he amount of available credit on your new account will be reduced by the amount 
transferred and the related balance transfer fees. We reserve the right to decli
ne to process any requested balance transfer. We will not process a request to t
ransfer a balance from any other account you may have with us. Balance transfers
 incur interest from the transaction date. You should not transfer the amount of
 any disputed purchase or other charge. If you do, you may lose your dispute rig
hts. Upon approval of your application we will process the requested balance tra
nsfer payment to the account(s) which you have requested on the 10th day after w
e've mailed you your card; during this 10 day time period you may cancel your ba
lance transfer by contacting us at the number on the back of your card. A balanc
e transfer may take up to 4 weeks to post to your other accounts. Continue to pa
y each creditor until the balance transfer appears on the other account as a cre
dit. If you would like to complete a balance transfer from another account that 
is not a Visa, Mastercard, American Express or Discover Card account, please cal
l the phone number on the back of your new credit card once you are approved. Ba
lance transfers are subject to availability. We may deny balance transfer reques
ts at any time and for any reason.Credit Limit: We do not permit applicants to r
equest a specific credit limit. We do not consider a request for a balance trans
fer made with an application to be a request for a particular credit limit. We d
etermine the credit limit on your account independent of and prior to processing
 any balance transfer request.Cash Equivalent Purchases: The purchase of money o
rders, travelers' checks, foreign currency, lottery tickets, gambling chips, wir
e transfers and other similar transactions are treated as cash advances. Please 
see your Cardmember Agreement for details.New York Residents: New York residents

ar wireless telephone (“phone” or “cell phone”) bill with their eligible covered
 credit card (“card”). You and Your means an enrolled cardmember who has charged
 their monthly cell phone bill to their card.Cell phones have become an everyday
 necessity, which means if Your cell phone is damaged or stolen, having it repai
red or replaced is not optional. Fortunately, Cellular Telephone Protection is a
vailable which provides coverage for damage to, theft of, or involuntary and acc
idental parting of Your cell phone. An involuntary and accidental parting is the
 unintended separation from Your cell phone when its location is known, but reco
very is impractical to complete.  This benefit is available if You are a cardmem
ber of a covered U.S. issued card enrolled in the Cellular Telephone Protection 
benefit and You charge Your monthly cell phone bill to Your card for the billing
 cycle before the month in which the incident occurs. Eligible cell phones are t
he lines listed on Your most recent cellular wireless service provider’s (“cell 
phone provider”) monthly billing statement for the billing cycle prior to when t
he incident occurred. What is covered?This benefit is supplemental coverage, whi
ch means that it will reimburse You for theft of, damage to or involuntary and a
ccidental parting of Your cell phone not otherwise covered by another insurance 
policy (for example: cell phone insurance programs,  or employer’s insurance pol
icies).Once all other applicable insurance  has been exhausted, Cellular Telepho
ne Protection will provide coverage up to six-hundred ($600.00) dollars per clai
m after You have paid the twenty-five ($25.00) dollar deductible, with a maximum
 of two (2) claims and twelve-hundred ($1200.00) dollars per twelve (12) month p
eriod. If it is determined that, due to the theft of, damage to, or an involunta
ry or accidental parting of, Your cell phone requires replacement, You will rece
ive the replacement value. If Your cell phone is repairable, You will receive an
 amount as determined by the diagnostic to repair the cell phone subject to the 
benefit maximum and deductible.The replacement value is the lesser of Your cell 
phone provider’s suggested retail value for the impacted device or the actual co
st to replace the cell phone.*Note: Electronic issues, such as inability to char
ge, mechanical or battery failure, where there is no evidence of physical damage
, are not covered under this program.When does it apply?Cellular Telephone Prote
ction applies when You make Your monthly cell phone bill payment with Your card.
 Coverage begins the first day of the calendar month following a payment of the 
cell phone bill. If You fail to make a cell phone bill payment in a particular m
onth, Your coverage will be suspended. Coverage will resume on the first day of 
the calendar month after the date any future cell phone bill payment is made wit
h the card. If Your cell phone is stolen as a result of criminal activity, You m
ust file a police report within forty-eight (48) hours of the event.What is not 
covered?This benefit will not provide reimbursement for the following:Cell phone
