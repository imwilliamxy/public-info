Gas station purchases not eligible to receive double miles include, but are not limited to, purchases made at warehouse clubs that do not code gas station purchases under a gas station code, discount stores, department stores and convenience stores.Each merchant – e.g., a retailer, business or any other place where you can make a purchase – is assigned a code that indicates the merchant's primary area of business. We don't assign or have any control over merchant codes. Codes are assigned by a third party. When you make a purchase at a merchant, we're provided the code for that merchant and if the code matches a category that gives you additional miles, you will earn the additional miles. Because we don't control what code a merchant is assigned, sometimes a purchase that you think fits a certain category may not earn additional miles. For example, a restaurant located within a large retail outlet may not be assigned a "restaurant" code, but rather a "retailer" code. This means that if you receive additional miles for "purchases at restaurants," you won't earn additional miles for purchases at that restaurant.Citi® reserves the right to determine which purchases qualify for this offer.
