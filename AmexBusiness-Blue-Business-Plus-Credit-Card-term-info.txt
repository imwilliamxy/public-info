If the airline upgrades your ticket(s) and the number of points available in your Membership Rewards program account is less than the number of points you originally offered, American Express will deduct only the number of points available and you will receive an accompanying credit only for that number of points. The credit to your Card Account may appear during a different billing cycle than the charge for upgrade. You are still responsible for paying the amount due on your Card statement by the due date. Any applicable taxes and fees in connection with an airline ticket upgrade will be charged to your Card Account and cannot be covered with points. The value of the points you offer is determined at the time your upgrade offer is accepted by the airline and may change after your upgrade offer has been submitted if you subsequently upgrade or downgrade your Card Account. Once accepted by the airline, your upgrade offer is nonrefundable, non-changeable, and points cannot be returned to your Membership Rewards program account.  Each airline determines whether to accept upgrade offers and which upgrade offers it will accept based on factors it determines in its discretion, including the amount of an offer. While it is possible for airlines to accept an upgrade offer at any time after offer submission, most upgrades are processed between 5 and 1 days before departure, and some are processed as close as 1 hour before departure. If your flight reservation includes tickets for more than one passenger, the tickets for all passengers on the reservation will be upgraded if your upgrade offer is accepted by the airline. If you would like to upgrade only certain passengers, you must contact the airline to split your reservation prior to requesting an upgrade. If your Card offers additional points for flights purchased directly from an airline, you will not receive additional points for your upgrade purchase. Participating airlines’ Terms & Conditions apply. Participating airlines are subject to change at any time without notice. Participating airline products and services are subject to change. American Express reserves the right to cancel any upgrade offers or discontinue the Upgrade with Points program at any time.  If you use a Pay Over Time feature for a purchase using Upgrade with Points, the statement credit you receive may not be applied to that feature. Instead, it might be applied to your Pay in Full balance. If you think this has happened, please call us using the number on the back of your Card.Using Points for ChargesUsing Points for Your Charges is only available to Basic Consumer and OPEN Card Members enrolled in the U.S. Membership Rewards® program. Additional Card Members, Authorized Additional Card Members, and Corporate Card Members are not eligible.
