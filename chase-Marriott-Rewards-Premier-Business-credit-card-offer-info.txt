          How you can earn points: You'll earn points when you, or an authorized user, use a Marriott Rewards® credit card to make purchases of products and services, minus returns or refunds.

"Participating Marriott and The Ritz-Carlton locations" means all Marriott and The Ritz-Carlton branded hotels which participate in Marriott Rewards or The Ritz-Carlton Rewards®. Go to marriottrewards.com, ritzcarltonrewards.com, or spg.com,, as applicable, for a list of participating locations. You will only receive the accelerated earn of 5 points for each $1 spent from the credit card program. You will not receive additional points under the Marriott Rewards program for stays at participating SPG® locations. 2 points ("2X points"): You'll earn 2 points for each $1 spent in the following rewards categories: restaurants; airline tickets purchased directly from the airline; car rental agencies; office supply stores; and internet, cable, and phone services. 1 point ("1X points"): You'll earn 1 point for each $1 spent on all other purchases. Information about earning/transferring points to Marriott Rewards: Points earned during a billing cycle will be automatically transferred to Marriott Rewards after the end of each billing cycle. Points expiration: The points transferred to your Marriott Rewards account won't expire as long as there is card earning activity or other qualifying earning or redemption activity every 24 months. If your card account is closed, you'll lose the points in your Marriott Rewards account if you don't have any other qualifying earning or redemption activity every 24 months. For details on this points expiration policy, visit www.marriott.com/marriott-rewards/terms/expiration.mi. Losing points: You'll immediately lose all points that haven't been transferred to Marriott Rewards if your card account status changes, or your card account is closed for program misuse, fraudulent activities, failure to pay, bankruptcy, or other reasons described in the terms of the Rewards Program Agreement. All Marriott Rewards terms and conditions apply, available at marriottrewards.com. Rewards Categories: Merchants who accept Visa/MasterCard credit cards are assigned a merchant code, which is determined by the merchant or its processor in accordance with Visa/MasterCard procedures based on the kinds of products and services they primarily sell. We group similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers to you. Please note: We make every effort to include all relevant merchant codes in our rewards categories. However, even though a merchant or some of the items that it sells may appear to fit within a rewards category, the merchant may not have a merchant code in that category. When this occurs, purchases with that merchant won't qualify for rewards offers on purchases in that category. Purchases submitted by you, an authorized user, or the merchant through third-party payment accounts, mobile or wireless card readers, online or mobile digital wallets, or similar technology will not qualify in a rewards category if the technology is not set up to process the purchase in that rewards category. For more information about Chase rewards categories, see www.Chase.com/RewardsCategoryFAQs.
