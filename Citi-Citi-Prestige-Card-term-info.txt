How to Avoid Paying Interest on Purchases



Your due date is at least 23 days after the close of each billing cycle. We will not charge you interest on purchases if you pay your monthly Citi Flex Plan Payment Amount plus your entire balance, excluding any Citi Flex Plan balances, by the due date each month.  If you do not pay your monthly Citi Flex Plan Payment plus your entire balance, excluding any Citi Flex Plan balances, by the due date each month, you will pay interest on your purchases from the date they're posted to your account.  We will begin charging interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the transaction date. We will begin charging interest on a Citi Flex Plan balance at the start of the billing cycle following the billing cycle during which you created the Citi Flex Plan.  




Minimum Interest Charge



If you are charged interest, the charge will be no less than 50 cents.

Balance Transfer Information

How to Make Balance Transfers



                   After receiving your card, you can call the customer service number on the back of your card to transfer balances. Balance transfers are made available at our discretion. All balance transfers are subject to the standard purchase APR unless an introductory and/or other promotional rate applies.
                

                    If we give you the option to transfer a balance with your application, it will take at least 14 days after your Card Account is opened to process any balance transfer payments. During this time, you may cancel or modify your balance transfer request by calling the number on the back of your card.
                

                    You may transfer any amount, but the total amount of your balance transfer plus balance transfer fees must be less than your available revolving credit limit. Be sure you don't transfer any disputed purchase or other charge amount because you may lose your dispute rights. You cannot transfer balances from other accounts issued by Citi or its affiliates. If you are unsure of the issuer on the account, please visit www.citi.com/affiliatesproducts for a list of Citi products and affiliates.
Continue to make payments on your other accounts until you have confirmed this balance transfer has been received. Once approved, we'll pay the amount of the balance transfer directly to that issuer. The available revolving credit limit for your new card will be reduced by the total amount of the transfers, including fees we approve.

Things You Should Know About Your Balance Transfer Offer:
If you transfer a balance with this offer, interest will be charged on purchases made with your credit card unless your purchases have a 0% APR or you pay the New Balance shown on your statement (including the amount of your balance transfer) in full by the payment due date each billing period.
If you default under your Card Agreement you may lose any promotional APR on the balance transfer.

Additional Information

    Any benefit, reward, service or feature offered in connection with your Card Account may change or be discontinued at any time for any reason, except as otherwise expressly indicated. Citi isn't responsible for products and services offered by other companies.


Citi® ThankYou® Rewards
Summary of the Citi Prestige® Card Terms and Conditions
With the Citi Prestige Card, you can earn ThankYou Points for purchases made on your card. Unless you are participating in a limited‐time offer, you will earn:
— 5 ThankYou Points for each $1 spent on purchases at airlines and travel agencies.
— 5 ThankYou Points for each $1 spent on purchases at restaurants (including cafes, bars, lounges and fast food restaurants).
— 3 ThankYou Points for each $1 spent on purchases at hotels.
— 3 ThankYou Points for each $1 spent on purchases at cruise lines.
— 1 ThankYou Point for each $1 spent on other purchases.
Certain Non-Qualifying Purchases.  
Restaurants – You won’t earn 5 ThankYou Points for each $1 spent on purchases at restaurants for purchases made at bakeries, caterers, restaurants/cafes inside other establishments (such as hotels, department stores, grocery stores, discount and convenience stores or warehouse clubs), or purchases made through online dining delivery services.
Only Purchases Earn Points. You'll earn Points for purchases using your Card Account, minus returns and refunds. The following types of transactions don't qualify as purchases that earn points: use of checks that access your card account, balance transfers, cash advances, travelers checks, foreign currency purchases, money orders, wire transfers and similar cash‐like transactions, lottery tickets, gaming chips and similar betting transactions, interest and account fees, unauthorized charges, items returned for credit
Merchant Classification for Rewards Categories.
Merchants are assigned a merchant category code ("MCC"), which is determined in accordance with Visa / Mastercard / American Express procedures based on the kinds of products and services the merchants primarily sell. We don't control the assignment of these codes and are not responsible for the codes used by merchants. When you use your card to make a purchase, we're provided an MCC for that purchase. We group similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers. Sometimes you may expect a purchase to fit within a rewards category, but if the code assigned to the merchant wasn't grouped into that category, your purchase will not qualify for additional points. For example, you won't earn additional points for purchases at a restaurant located within a retailer if the restaurant is assigned a "retailer" code instead of a "restaurant" code.  Please also note – purchases made through mobile/wireless technology may not earn additional points depending on how the technology is set up to process the purchase. We reserve the exclusive right to determine which purchases qualify for additional points. Please see our Earning Points FAQs at thankyou.com/help for more information.

$250 TRAVEL CREDIT
Your Card Account is eligible to receive statement credits of up to $250 per calendar year for Travel Purchases made by the Primary cardmember or Authorized Users and which appear on your billing statement during that calendar year (“Travel Credit”). Citi will automatically post available Travel Credit(s) after eligible Travel Purchases appear on your statement.  Please allow one to two billing cycles after the qualifying purchase is charged to your Card Account for statement credit(s) to be posted to the account.

Travel Purchases are defined as purchases made within the travel category, including purchases from airlines, hotels, car rental agencies, travel agencies/travel aggregators/tour operators, commuter transportation, ferries, commuter railways, subways, taxis/limousines/car services, passenger railways, cruise lines, bridge and road tolls, parking lots/garages, and bus lines.
Cardmembers are responsible for payment of all charges on the Card Account regardless of eligibility for statement credit.
The Travel Credit is intended only for personal travel, and not for business travel.

To be eligible for this benefit, the enrolled Card Account must be open and current at the time of statement credit fulfillment.
COMPLIMENTARY FOURTH NIGHT HOTEL BENEFIT
Cardmembers will enjoy a complimentary fourth night with no black–out dates ("Fourth Night"), when booking at least four consecutive nights at any hotel only through Thankyou.com or by phone at 1–800–ThankYou (powered by Connexions) and subject to additional requirements stated below. All bookings must be made through the ThankYou.com or by phone at 1–800–ThankYou. The amount due to you for the Fourth Night benefit will be based on the average nightly rate of your stay (excluding taxes and fees). When booked through Thankyou.com or 1–800–ThankYou, the complimentary night savings will be provided at the time of booking. Cardmembers are eligible for no more than two complimentary Fourth Night benefits per Card Account per calendar year. To receive your Fourth Night benefit, you must 1) book a minimum of a four–consecutive–night hotel stay through thankyou.com and 2) pay for your complete stay with your Citi Prestige Card, a redemption of ThankYou Points, or a combination of ThankYou Points and your Citi Prestige Card.

Eligibility Requirements

Reservations must be made by the primary cardmember. Reservations can be in the primary cardmember or Authorized Users' name.
Only one complimentary night is eligible per each stay. A stay is consecutive nights booked and stayed on one reservation and does not include back-to back stays. Back-to back stays are stays at the same hotel booked on two reservations (as an example, you book four nights at a hotel on one reservation for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday and book another four nights on another reservation for Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. In this situation, you would only be eligible for one complimentary night for the eight-night stay).
For group reservations, or other reservations consisting of multiple rooms, only one room will qualify for one complimentary night.
Packaged rates, such as air and hotel, hotel and car rental do not qualify for this benefit.
Hotel imposed fees and incidental guest charges are the cardmember's responsibility and are not included in the calculation of the Complimentary Fourth Night benefit.
Reservations made through any party or channel other than Thankyou.com are not eligible for the Complimentary Fourth Night benefit.
The complimentary Fourth Night benefit is intended only for personal use by the primary cardmember, and not for business travel.
