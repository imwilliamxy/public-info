How to Avoid Paying Interest on Purchases



Your due date is at least 23 days after the close of each billing cycle. We will not charge you interest on purchases if you pay your monthly Citi Flex Plan Payment Amount plus your entire balance, excluding any Citi Flex Plan balances, by the due date each month.  If you do not pay your monthly Citi Flex Plan Payment plus your entire balance, excluding any Citi Flex Plan balances, by the due date each month, you will pay interest on your purchases from the date they're posted to your account.  We will begin charging interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the transaction date. We will begin charging interest on a Citi Flex Plan balance at the start of the billing cycle following the billing cycle during which you created the Citi Flex Plan.  




Minimum Interest Charge



If you are charged interest, the charge will be no less than 50 cents.

Balance Transfer Information

How to Make Balance Transfers



                   After receiving your card, you can call the customer service number on the back of your card to transfer balances. Balance transfers are made available at our discretion. All balance transfers are subject to the standard purchase APR unless an introductory and/or other promotional rate applies.
                

                    If we give you the option to transfer a balance with your application, it will take at least 14 days after your Card Account is opened to process any balance transfer payments. During this time, you may cancel or modify your balance transfer request by calling the number on the back of your card.
                

                    You may transfer any amount, but the total amount of your balance transfer plus balance transfer fees must be less than your available credit limit. Be sure you don't transfer any disputed purchase or other charge amount because you may lose your dispute rights. You cannot transfer balances from other accounts issued by Citi or its affiliates. If you are unsure of the issuer on the account, please visit www.citi.com/affiliatesproducts for a list of Citi products and affiliates.
Continue to make payments on your other accounts until you have confirmed this balance transfer has been received. Once approved, we'll pay the amount of the balance transfer directly to that issuer. The available credit limit for your new card will be reduced by the total amount of the transfers, including fees we approve.

Things You Should Know About Your Balance Transfer Offer:
If you transfer a balance with this offer, interest will be charged on purchases made with your credit card unless your purchases have a 0% APR or you pay the New Balance shown on your statement (including the amount of your balance transfer) in full by the payment due date each billing period.
If you default under your Card Agreement you may lose any promotional APR on the balance transfer.

Unless you are participating in a limited–time offer, you will earn:
2 ThankYou Points for each $1 spent on products and services purchased directly from AT&T, including payment of monthly phone, cable or internet bills.
Certain Non–Qualifying Purchases. You won't earn 2X Points for purchases from independent wireless dealers or AT&T resellers unless you are paying for an AT&T service, such as phone, cable or internet.

Merchant Classification for Rewards Categories. Merchants are assigned a merchant category code (“MCC”), which is determined in accordance with Visa, Mastercard, or American Express procedures based on the kinds of products and services the merchants primarily sell. We don't control the assignment of these codes and are not responsible for the codes used by merchants. When you use your card to make a purchase, we're provided an MCC for that purchase. We group similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers. Sometimes you may expect a purchase to fit within a rewards category, but if the code assigned to the merchant wasn't grouped into that category, your purchase will not qualify for additional points. For example, you won't earn additional points for purchases at a restaurant located within a retailer if the restaurant is assigned a “retailer” code instead of a “restaurant” code.  Please also note – purchases made through mobile/wireless technology may not earn additional miles depending on how the technology is set up to process the purchase. We reserve the exclusive right to determine which purchases qualify for additional points. Please see our FAQs at thankyou.com/help or call the ThankYou Service Center at 1-800-THANKYOU (1-800-842-6596) for more information about merchant codes and categories.
You may earn ThankYou Points as long as your card account is open and current. If your Card Account is closed, you will not be able to earn and redeem ThankYou Points and you will lose any accumulated ThankYou Points that have not been transferred to your ThankYou Member Account (we will set up a ThankYou Member Account for you).
ThankYou Rewards may be terminated with 30 days prior written notice. If ThankYou Rewards is terminated, you will have 90 days from ThankYou Rewards termination date to redeem all your accumulated ThankYou Points. The ThankYou Rewards program may be changed at any time. Rewards offered by ThankYou Rewards and the ThankYou Point levels required for specific rewards are subject to change without notice.
ThankYou Points earned from purchases post to your Card Account at the close of each billing cycle, and at that time we will transfer the ThankYou Points you earned to your ThankYou Member Account. (Bonus ThankYou Points may take one to two additional billing cycles to post to your Card Account). ThankYou Points are not eligible for redemption until they are transferred to your ThankYou Member Account.
