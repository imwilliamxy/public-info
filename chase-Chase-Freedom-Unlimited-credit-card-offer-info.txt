                                                                   All correspon
dence, including credit cards, statements, and notifications will be sent to the
 name and address on file for the primary cardmember. The primary cardmember is 
responsible for repaying all balances on this account. Authorized users will hav
e the same account number and charging privileges as the primary cardmember but 
will not be financially responsible. Chase provides account information to the c
redit reporting agencies for all account users. This information could impact an
 authorized user's credit score. When you tell us to add a user to your account,
 you're confirming that you have a relationship with the person or people whose 
name(s), address(es), and date of birth(s) you've told us, that all their inform
ation is correct, and that you have their consent to add them. If Chase determin
es you've given us fraudulent name, address, or date of birth information, or di
d not have such consent, Chase can close this account.

   Zero Liability Protection does not apply to use of an account by an authorize
d user without the approval of the primary cardmember. If you think someone used
 your account without permission, tell us immediately by calling the Cardmember 
Services number on your card or billing statement.
