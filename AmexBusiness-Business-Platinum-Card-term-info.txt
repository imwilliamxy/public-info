t Manager(s) on the Card Account can select the qualifying airline. Card Members
 who have not chosen a qualifying airline will be able to do so at any time. Car
d Members who have already selected a qualifying airline will be able to change 
their choice one time each year in January at www.americanexpress.com/airlinecho
ice or by calling the number on the back of the Card. Card Members who do not ch
ange their airline selection will remain with their current airline. The qualify
ing airline Business Platinum Card Members select for this $200 benefit and the 
35% Airline Bonus must be the same. Statement Credits: Incidental air travel fee
s must be charged to the Card Member on the eligible Card Account for the benefi
t to apply. Incidental air travel fees charged by both the Basic and Additional 
Card Members on the eligible Card Account are eligible for statement credits. Ho
wever, each Card Account is eligible for up to a total of $200 per calendar year
 in statement credits across all Cards on the Account. Incidental air travel fee
s must be separate charges from airline ticket charges. Fees not charged by the 
Card Member's airline of choice (e.g. wireless internet and fees incurred with a
irline alliance partners) do not qualify for statement credits. Incidental air t
ravel fees charged prior to selection of a qualifying airline are not eligible f
or statement credits. Airline tickets, upgrades, mileage points purchases, milea
ge points transfer fees, gift cards, duty free purchases, and award tickets are 
not deemed to be incidental fees. The airline must submit the charge under the a
ppropriate merchant code, industry code, or required service or product identifi
er for the charge to be recognized as an incidental air travel fee. Please allow
 2-4 weeks after the qualifying incidental air travel fee is charged to your Car
d Account for statement credit(s) to be posted to the Account. We rely on airlin
es to submit the correct information on airline transactions, so please call the
 number on the back of the Card if statement credits have not posted after 4 wee
ks from the date of purchase. Card Members remain responsible for timely payment
 of all charges. To be eligible for this benefit, Card Account(s) must be not ca
nceled and not past due at the time of statement credit fulfillment. If a charge
 for any incidental air travel fee is included in a Pay Over Time feature balanc
e on your Card Account (for example, Sign &amp; Travel), the statement credit as
sociated with that charge may not be applied to that Pay Over Time feature balan
ce. Instead, the statement credit may be applied to your Pay In Full balance. Fo
