DetailsMedallion Qualification Dollar WaiverEffective Through December 31, 2019: If the Medallion Qualification Dollar (MQD) thresholds are not met for a Qualification Year, you can still qualify for Platinum, Gold and Silver Medallion Status if you have earned the required Medallion Qualification Miles (MQMs) or Medallion Qualification Segments (MQSs) and make at least $25,000 in eligible purchases within that Qualification Year on your Eligible Card. If the MQD threshold is not met for a Qualification Year, you can qualify for Diamond Medallion Status if you have earned the required MQMs or MQSs and make at least $250,000 in eligible purchases within that Qualification Year on your Eligible Card. A Qualification Year is from January 1 to December 31 of a given year.

Eligible purchases do NOT include fees, interest charges, balance transfers (balance transfers are not available on Delta SkyMiles® Business Credit Cards), cash advances, purchases of travelers' checks, person-to-person transactions, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, or purchases of other cash equivalents. Eligible purchases may fall outside of the Qualification Year in some cases, such as a delay in merchants submitting transactions to us or if the purchase date differs from the date you made the transaction. For example, if you buy goods online, the purchase date may be the date the goods are shipped. This may result in a delay in receiving the MQD Waiver.
