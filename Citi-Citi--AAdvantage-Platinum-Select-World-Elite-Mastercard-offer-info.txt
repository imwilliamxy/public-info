I will be in India for a month during that time which upset me so I called the number on the card- it took 3 minutes to listen to all the choices before I could speak with someone- and the guy said I would be fine and they wouldn't cancel my card until I updated the new one which should be at my house when I return. He would not give me a date as to how long I could use my current card. Why is the card I just got 3 months ago being cancelled? It is infuriating that I have to contact all the auto payments I just updated a few months ago. Apparently American Express does that for you.
The agent I spoke with did not really seem to care-I'm sure he's heard that complaint before. He said they do this every so often.
I don't think I've ever had preferred boarding so I'm not checking it below. This is the main credit card I use for everything and have been flying for years with the mileage program which I really like. I would love to have preferred boarding. How does that work?  And I don't know how to get on the higher levels (elite status?) of this card for traveling.
That being said I have been using this card for decades and greatly appreciate that I can fly with my mileage points for all of my trips around the world. I have been to Bali, New Zealand, Nepal, Chile, India and Africa -to name a few- all with my mileage points. I always recommend this card to friends.More DetailsWhich card benefit do you enjoy the most?2X miles on American Airlines purchases, First checked bag free on domestic itineraries, No foreign transaction fees on purchasesCustomer Service4Rated 4 out of 5 starsOnline Account Access5Rated 5 out of 5 starsBottom Line Yes, I would recommend to a friendWas this review helpful to you?00Flag this review5Highly recommendedRated 5 out of 5 starsSubmitted  2 days ago By Chris From Lincolnshire, ILVerified BuyerVerified BuyerVerified BuyerGreat benefits & excellent customer service!More DetailsWhich card benefit do you enjoy the most?2X miles on American Airlines purchases, First checked bag free on domestic itineraries, Preferred boardingCustomer Service5Rated 5 out of 5 starsOnline Account Access5Rated 5 out of 5 starsBottom Line Yes, I would recommend to a friendWas this review helpful to you?00Flag this review5Per your requestRated 5 out of 5 starsSubmitted  2 days ago By Tim From Los AngelesVerified BuyerVerified BuyerVerified BuyerLike your OffersMore DetailsWhich card benefit do you enjoy the most?2X miles on American Airlines purchases, First checked bag free on domestic itineraries, No foreign transaction fees on purchases, Preferred boardingCustomer Service5Rated 5 out of 5 starsOnline Account Access5Rated 5 out of 5 starsBottom Line Yes, I would recommend to a friendWas this review helpful to you?00Flag this review5CARD HAS BEEN A BLESSINGRated 5 out of 5 starsSubmitted  2 days ago By Bob the Baptist From Oak Harbor, WAVerified BuyerVerified BuyerVerified BuyerI switched over to this card just over a year ago, and it has met all of its promises concerning benefits.More DetailsWhich card benefit do you enjoy the most?First checked bag free on domestic itineraries, No foreign transaction fees on purchasesCustomer Service4Rated 4 out of 5 starsOnline Account Access5Rated 5 out of 5 starsBottom Line Yes, I would recommend to a friendWas this review helpful to you?00Flag this review5Fly in American Airline the bestRated 5 out of 5 starsSubmitted  2 days ago By Gabo From San Pablo californiaVerified BuyerVerified BuyerVerified BuyerI am very happy with AA services and flying.
