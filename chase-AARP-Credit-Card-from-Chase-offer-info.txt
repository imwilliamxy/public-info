   Rewards Program Agreement: For more information about the AARP Credit Card fr
om Chase rewards program, view the latest Rewards Program Agreement. We will mai
l your Rewards Program Agreement once your account is established. If you become
 a Chase Online customer, your Rewards Program Agreement will also be available 
after logging in to chase.com.          Cash Back and Points: "Cash Back rewards
" are the rewards you earn under the program. Cash Back rewards are tracked as p
oints and each $1 in Cash Back rewards earned is equal to 100 points. You may si
mply see "Cash Back" in marketing materials when referring to the rewards you ea
rn. How you can earn points: You'll earn points when you, or an authorized user,
 use an AARP Credit Card from Chase to make purchases of products and services, 
minus returns or refunds. Buying products and services with your card, in most c
ases, will count as a purchase; however, the following types of transactions won
't count and won't earn points: balance transfers, cash advances and other cash-
like transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or si
milar betting transactions, any checks that access your account, interest, unaut
horized or fraudulent charges, and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if
 applicable. 3% Cash Back: You'll earn 3% Cash Back rewards for each $1 spent on
 purchases in the following rewards categories: gas stations and restaurants. 1%
 Cash Back: You'll earn 1% Cash Back rewards for each $1 spent on all other purc
hases. How you can use your points: You can use your points to redeem for any av
ailable reward options, including cash, an AARPÂ® membership, gift cards, travel,
 and products or services made available through the program or directly from th
ird party merchants. Redemption values for reward options vary. Points expiratio
n/losing points: Your points don't expire as long as your account is open, howev
er, you'll immediately lose all your points if your account status changes, or y
our account is closed for program misuse, fraudulent activities, failure to pay,
 bankruptcy, or other reasons described in the terms of the Rewards Program Agre
ement. Rewards Categories: Merchants who accept Visa/MasterCard credit cards are
 assigned a merchant code, which is determined by the merchant or its processor 
in accordance with Visa/MasterCard procedures based on the kinds of products and
 services they primarily sell. We group similar merchant codes into categories f
or purposes of making rewards offers to you. Please note: We make every effort t
o include all relevant merchant codes in our rewards categories. However, even t
hough a merchant or some of the items that it sells may appear to fit within a r
ewards category, the merchant may not have a merchant code in that category. Whe
n this occurs, purchases with that merchant won't qualify for rewards offers on 
purchases in that category. Purchases submitted by you, an authorized user, or t
he merchant through third-party payment accounts, mobile or wireless card reader
s, online or mobile digital wallets, or similar technology will not qualify in a
 rewards category if the technology is not set up to process the purchase in tha
t rewards category. For more information about Chase rewards categories, see www
