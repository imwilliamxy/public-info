 similar cash-like transactions), lottery tickets, gaming chips (and similar bet

 business or any other place where you can make a purchase - is assigned a code 
that indicates the merchant's primary area of business. We don't assign or have 
any control over merchant codes. Codes are chosen and assigned by a third party,
 who may change the codes from time to time. When you make a purchase at a merch
ant, we're provided the code for that merchant and if the code matches a categor
y that gives you additional points, you will earn the additional points. Because
 we don't control what code a merchant is assigned, sometimes a purchase that yo
u think fits a certain category may not earn additional points. For example, a r
estaurant located within a large retail outlet may not be assigned a "restaurant
" code, but rather a "retailer" code. This means that if you receive additional 
points for "dining out," you won't earn additional points for purchases at that 
restaurant. Or a restaurant located within a hotel may not be assigned a "restau
rant" code, but rather a "hotel" code. This means that if you receive more point
