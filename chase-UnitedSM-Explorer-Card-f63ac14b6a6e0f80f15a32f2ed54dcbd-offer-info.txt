                        Rewards Program Agreement: For more information about the UnitedSM Explorer Card rewards program, view the latest Rewards Program Agreement. We will mail your Rewards Program Agreement once your account is established. If you become a Chase Online customer, your Rewards Program Agreement will also be available after logging in to chase.com.
How you can earn miles: You'll earn miles when you, or an authorized user, use a UnitedSM credit card to make purchases of products and services, minus returns or refunds. Buying products and services with your card, in most cases, will count as a purchase; however, the following types of transactions won't count and won't earn miles: balance transfers, cash advances and other cash-like transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting transactions, any checks that access your account, interest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if applicable. 1 mile: You'll earn 1 mile for each $1 spent. 2 miles: You'll earn 2 miles total for each $1 spent (1 additional mile on top of the 1 mile per $1 earned on each purchase) on airline tickets purchased from United. The following purchases made from United also earn 2 miles total for each $1 spent: seat upgrades; Economy Plus®; inflight food, beverages and Wi-Fi; baggage service charges or other United fees. Other United related purchases, such as United Cruises®, MileagePlus X, DIRECTV® and Merchandise Awards, are excluded. United tickets booked through some discount travel websites or as part of a third-party travel package will also not qualify. You'll also earn 2 miles total for each $1 spent (1 additional mile on top of the 1 mile per $1 earned on each purchase) in the following rewards categories: restaurants; hotel accommodations when purchased directly with the hotel. Information about earning/transferring miles to United: Miles earned during a billing cycle will be automatically transferred to United after the end of each billing cycle. Miles expiration: The miles transferred to your MileagePlus® account will not expire as long as your credit card account is open. If your credit card account is closed, or if you change your account to a Chase United Credit Card account which does not have an annual fee, your miles will expire according to the MileagePlus program rules. Losing miles: You'll immediately lose all miles that haven't been transferred to United if your card account status changes, or your card account is closed for program misuse, fraudulent activities, failure to pay, bankruptcy or other reasons described in the terms of the Rewards Program Agreement. Rewards Categories: Merchants who accept Visa/MasterCard credit cards are assigned a merchant code, which is determined by the merchant or its processor in accordance with Visa/MasterCard procedures based on the kinds of products and services they primarily sell. We group similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers to you. Please note: We make every effort to include all relevant merchant codes in our rewards categories. However, even though a merchant or some of the items that it sells may appear to fit within a rewards category, the merchant may not have a merchant code in that category. When this occurs, purchases with that merchant won't qualify for rewards offers on purchases in that category. Purchases submitted by you, an authorized user, or the merchant through third-party payment accounts, mobile or wireless card readers, online or mobile digital wallets, or similar technology will not qualify in a rewards category if the technology is not set up to process the purchase in that rewards category. For more information about Chase rewards categories, see chase.com/RewardsCategoryFAQs.

                        Individuals whose requests for this offer are not approved will not be enrolled in MileagePlus® through this request, although existing MileagePlus members will remain enrolled in MileagePlus. Authorized users will not be enrolled in MileagePlus as a result of this request. MileagePlus miles awarded through the use of the authorized user's card will only be credited to the primary cardmember's account. If a cardmember's membership in United's MileagePlus Program is terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions of that Program, the cardmember will no longer be eligible to earn any MileagePlus miles for purchases using the United Card. Chase's sole obligation concerning the award and redemption of miles shall be to make a valid request to United to award miles to the cardmember's associated MileagePlus account. Chase disclaims liability or responsibility for United's failure to award or redeem miles to the cardmember's associated MileagePlus account after Chase has met its obligations to United in connection with such a request. Benefits are available as long as cardmember's UnitedSM Explorer Credit Card account is open and not in default. Upon closure of the cardmember's United Explorer Credit Card account, all benefits will be canceled.
