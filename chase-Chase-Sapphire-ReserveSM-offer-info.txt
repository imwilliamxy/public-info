rn points when you, or an authorized user, use a Chase Sapphire ReserveSM credit
 card to make purchases of products and services, minus returns or refunds. Buyi
ng products and services with your card, in most cases, will count as a purchase
; however, the following types of transactions won't count and won't earn points
: balance transfers, cash advances and other cash-like transactions, lottery tic
kets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting transactions, an
y checks that access your account, interest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges,
 and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if applicable. 3 points ("3X poi
nts"): You'll earn 3 points for each $1 spent when your card is used for purchas
es in the travel category or the dining at restaurants category. 1 point ("1X po
ints"): You'll earn 1 point for each $1 spent on all other purchases. How you ca

tions, including cash, gift cards, travel, and products or services made availab
le through the program or directly from third party merchants. Redemption values
 for reward options vary. Points expiration/losing points: Your points don't exp

 your points if your account status changes, or your account is closed for progr
am misuse, fraudulent activities, failure to pay, bankruptcy, or other reasons d

hants who accept Visa/MasterCard credit cards are assigned a merchant code, whic
h is determined by the merchant or its processor in accordance with Visa/MasterC
ard procedures based on the kinds of products and services they primarily sell. 
We group similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards o
ffers to you. Please note: We make every effort to include all relevant merchant
 codes in our rewards categories. However, even though a merchant or some of the
 items that it sells may appear to fit within a rewards category, the merchant m
ay not have a merchant code in that category. When this occurs, purchases with t
hat merchant won't qualify for rewards offers on purchases in that category. Pur
chases submitted by you, an authorized user, or the merchant through third-party
 payment accounts, mobile or wireless card readers, online or mobile digital wal
lets, or similar technology will not qualify in a rewards category if the techno
logy is not set up to process the purchase in that rewards category. For more in
formation about Chase rewards categories, see www.Chase.com/RewardsCategoryFAQs.
                                                                                
            50% More in Travel Redemption                                       
                                 When you use points to redeem for cash, each po
int is worth $.01 (one cent), which means that 100 points equals $1 in redemptio
n value. Each point you redeem for travel booked through Chase Ultimate Rewards 
is worth $.0150 (one and a half cents), which means that 100 points equals $1.50
 in redemption value, and points are worth 50% more than if redeemed for cash. F
or example, 50,000 points are worth $750 towards travel, or $500 when redeemed f
or cash. The cost of travel is based on the rates and fares available through th
e Ultimate Rewards website and travel center, and may not reflect all rates and 
fares that are available through other sales channels.

   A statement credit will automatically be applied to your account when your ca
rd is used for purchases in the travel category, up to an annual maximum accumul
ation of $300. Annual means the year beginning with your account open date throu
gh the first statement date after your account open date anniversary, and the 12
 monthly billing cycles after that each year. (For applications submitted before
 May 21, 2017, annual means the year beginning with your account open date throu
gh the first December statement date of that same year, and the 12 billing cycle
s starting after your December statement date through the following December sta
tement date each year.) Call the number on the back of your card to see when you
 are eligible for your next $300 Annual Travel Credit. Purchases are when you, o
r an authorized user, use a card to make purchases of products and services. Buy

cash advances, travelers checks, foreign currency, money orders, wire transfers 
or similar cash-like transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race tr

o your account and will appear on your monthly credit card billing statement wit
hin 1-2 billing cycles. The Annual Travel Credit will be issued for the year in 
which the transaction posts to your account. For example, if you pay for baggage
 fees, but the airline does not post the transaction until after the current ann
ual period ends, the cost of the baggage fees will be allocated towards the foll
owing year's Annual Travel Credit maximum of $300.
