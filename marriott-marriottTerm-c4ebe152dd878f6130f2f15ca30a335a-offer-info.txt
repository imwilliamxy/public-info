(collectively, the “Company”) as three separate programs, will function as one unified program (hereinafter, the “Loyalty Program”) while keeping their separate names for the time being for certain limited purposes.

The Loyalty Program will operate under one set of terms and conditions as set out below unless otherwise expressly stated (the “Program Rules”).

The Program Rules govern the Company’s relationship with members of the Loyalty Program (collectively, “Loyalty Program Members,” and individually, a “Loyalty Program Member,” “Member,” or “you”), including how Members manage their accounts, book reservations, achieve elite status, earn and redeem Loyalty Program points (“Points”) with participating hotels and properties (each a “Participating Property”), as well as with third party programs which have a business relationship with the Loyalty Program such as airline frequent flyer programs (“Partner Programs”).

By opening a Loyalty Program membership account (“Account” or “Membership Account”), or by using either your membership card or the Membership Account number you were assigned (“Membership Number”) to receive and redeem benefits of the Loyalty Program, including, without limitation, Loyalty Program Points, you agree that:
you have read and accept these Program Rules; and you have read and accept the Website Terms of Use which are incorporated by reference herein; and

you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal data by the Company, the Loyalty Program, Participating Properties and Partner Programs, and their authorized third-party agents and licensees in accordance with the Company’s Privacy Statement.
All Loyalty Program benefits, amenities, offers, awards and services are subject to availability and may be changed by the Company at any time without notice. The Company may terminate the Loyalty Program or any of the individual Legacy Programs, in whole or in part, with six (6) months' advance notice to all active Loyalty Members and with less than six months' notice in any jurisdiction if required to do so by applicable law. At the Company’s sole discretion, the Company may choose to substitute a similar loyalty program for any of the Legacy Programs or for the Loyalty Program at any time immediately upon notice to active Loyalty Members. If any of the Legacy Programs or the Loyalty Program are terminated, all unredeemed Points will be forfeited without any obligation or liability, and no Redemption Award claims or promotional Award claims will be honored after the conclusion of the notice period.

These Program Rules supersede all previous terms and conditions applicable to the Legacy Programs or Loyalty Program. Except as otherwise expressly prohibited or limited by applicable laws, Company may at any time amend, modify or supplement these Program Rules, the structure for earning awards (“Awards,” and individually, an "Award") and Award levels at any time, with or without notice, even though such changes may affect the value of Points or Miles, or the ability to obtain certain Awards (collectively “Program Rules Changes”). Loyalty Members are responsible for remaining knowledgeable of the Program Rules and any Program Rule Changes. Your continued participation in the Loyalty Program will constitute your acceptance of any such Program Rule Changes.

1.4.g.  Use of Information Collected in Application.  The information a Member provides to the Company when completing the Loyalty Program application and redeeming Points is processed in accordance with the Company’s Privacy Statement.  Communication of relevant information is important to administering the Loyalty Program and providing each Member with the opportunity to maximize the benefits of Membership.  The Loyalty Program will only disclose Member information to:  the Company, person(s) authorized by the Member; franchisees, fulfillment houses, email service providers and mail houses that process mail for such entities; Authorized Licensees (as defined in the Company’s Privacy Statement); and marketing companies that provide services to the Company.  Member information will, in each case, only be disclosed for one or more of the following purposes:  1) in order to better service the Membership Account and the Member’s preferences by keeping the Member informed of Account status and activities through printed or electronic statements; 2) to assess a Member’s entitlement to benefits; 3) to collect and process Member charges incurred at the Company’s facilities; 4) to offer a Member additional products and services; 5) to send periodic satisfaction or market research surveys; and/or 6) to offer a Member products or services from select reputable companies with whom the Loyalty Program has a strategic relationship because the Loyalty Program believes their offerings will be of interest to the Member.  In choosing to become a Loyalty Program Member, the Member consents to receive all the types of information described above, but the Member will be given the opportunity to define and modify mailing and other communication preferences.          
                          
                          
                            
                            
                                    1.5   Membership Communications    1.5.a.  While the Loyalty Program will function as one unified program, the Legacy Programs will, for the time being, continue to exist as separate branded programs with unique Member communications that focus on properties and marketing opportunities associated with the relevant Legacy Program.  When enrolling in the Loyalty Program, a Member will receive communications from the Legacy Program he or she enrolled in. 

1.5.b.  All Loyalty Program communications will be sent to a Member’s mailing address or email address currently provided in the Member’s Account.  Communications delivered to the address on file will be deemed to have been received one (1) business day after sending it if delivered to the Member’s email address or five (5) business days after sending it if delivered to the mailing address provided.  Members must keep their email and mailing addresses current.  Neither the Company nor the Loyalty Program shall have any responsibility for misdirected or lost mail or any consequences thereof.

1.5.c.  Members will receive regular Points balance reports by email, provided there has been a transaction on the account since the last Points balance report and the Member provided the Company with the appropriate permission to contact the Member via email.

1.5.d.  The Company may also send Members promotions, offers and other communications from time to time, which may include, without limitation, items from third parties.  The items from third parties are based on the information provided to the Company by a Member and any additional data the Company may maintain.  Members may change personal details and communications preferences at any time in the Account Profile  on the  Loyalty Program website  or by contacting Member Support; however, the Company may require a Member to send supporting documentation prior to allowing certain changes (e.g., legal name changes).

1.5.e.  Any time a Member contacts Member Support, the Company may ask the Member certain security questions to verify the Member’s identity.  Member Support may monitor or record telephone calls to improve quality of service.

1.5.f.  A Member can review his/her Points balance and transaction history and update personal details and preferences in the Account Profile on the Loyalty Program website. A Membership Number or his/her user name and password are required to access the website.

1.7.i.  No Sale or Transfer.  Points, Redemption Awards, promotional Awards and other Member benefits may not be sold, bartered or transferred (other than by the Company or its agents).  Any attempted transfer, sale or barter will be void and will be confiscated.  The Company and its partners may refuse to honor or recognize any Points, Redemption Awards, promotional Awards or Member benefits which the Company believes may have been transferred, sold or bartered.

A Member may earn only one currency - Points or Miles.  A Member may not earn both Points and Miles for the same stay.  A Member may switch from earning Points to Miles, or vice versa, before a given Stay by updating his or her Membership profile or by contacting Member Support. A Member will begin earning the new “currency” (Points or Miles) with the next Stay. Previous earnings will not be converted to the new currency.  If the Member wishes to “convert” Points into Miles, he or she may do so in accordance with Section 3.11.          
                          
                          
                            
                            
                                    2.3      Earning Miles instead of Points.

The Loyalty Program has the right to change, limit, modify or cancel the Program Rules for the Elite Program at any time, with or without notice, pursuant to section 1.7.c.  Participating Properties outside the United States may provide alternative services and benefits to the Elite membership benefits set forth in these Program Rules, depending on local law and policy.  The ambassador service is a benefit of the Loyalty Program available to select Loyalty Program Platinum Premier Elite Members exclusively by invitation or by meeting the requirements outlined in section 4.2.b. Participation in the ambassador service will be evaluated on an annual basis.

4.1.b.  Pursuant to section 1.7.a., the Company reserves the right to revoke, cancel or suspend a Member’s Elite membership status (including Lifetime Silver Elite, Lifetime Gold Elite and Lifetime Platinum Elite status), any Loyalty Program Membership, Award, and/or any and all unredeemed Points or Miles, or take other action at its discretion, at any time with immediate effect and without written notice if the Company believes the Member has (a) violated any of the Program Rules, (b) failed to pay any bills or accounts due to the Company or a Participating Property or any ownership related fees owed to Marriott Vacation Club properties, Marriott Grand Residence Club properties, or participating Vistana properties, (c) acted in a manner inconsistent with applicable law, regulations or ordinances, (d) engaged in any misconduct or wrongdoing in connection with the Marriott Loyalty Program, including without limitation, involving Point credit, Mile credit, Award use, or Member benefits, or (e) engaged in abusive, fraudulent, inappropriate, or hostile conduct in connection with the Marriott Loyalty Program, the Participating Properties or their guests or employees, or the Company or its employees.  Nothing in these Program Rules will limit Company from exercising any legal rights or remedies that it may have.

ii.      If an Elite Member believes that compensation is due with respect to any aspect of the Elite Benefits Guarantee, he/she must request payment of the compensation while still a guest at the Participating Property, prior to checking out.  Failure to request such payment prior to check out will result in a complete waiver of any right to receive such compensation.

4.2.e.  Earning Lifetime Elite Status

i.     In order to obtain Lifetime Elite Status, a Member must meet the below Lifetime Elite Status Criteria (4.2.f.) during the Member’s participation in the Loyalty Program.  An “Eligible Status Year” is a calendar year during which a Member obtained Elite membership status (Silver Elite, Gold Elite, Platinum Elite or Platinum Premier Elite) by achieving the Silver Elite, Gold Elite, Platinum Elite or Platinum Premier Elite Minimum Requirement during such Eligible Status Year.  Only a calendar year in which a Member achieves Silver Elite, Gold Elite, Platinum Elite or Platinum Premier Elite Status, as described in the prior sentence, will count as an Eligible Status Year, regardless of the length of time that such Member will retain the benefits of Elite membership Status.  For example, if a Member meets the Gold Elite Minimum Requirement during the 2018 Eligible Status Year by earning twenty-five (25) Eligible Nights and becomes a Gold Elite Member for the remainder of 2018 and for all of 2019, 2018 will count as a single Eligible Status Year, but 2019 will not count as an Eligible Status Year unless the Member meets the Gold Elite Minimum Requirement during the 2019 Eligible Status Year.

ii.     The Company will determine, in its sole discretion, whether or not a Member has met the requirements to achieve Lifetime Elite Status.  Once a Member achieves Lifetime Elite Status, the Member is not subject to meeting the Gold Elite Minimum Requirement in any subsequent Eligible Status Year in order to remain a Gold Elite Member unless the Gold Elite Member’s account was cancelled.

iii.     Lifetime Elite Status only provides a Member with Silver Elite, Gold Elite or Platinum Elite status and protection against the forfeiture of Points even if the Lifetime Elite Member is inactive.  It does not prevent the Company from suspending Lifetime Elite Status or cancelling a Member’s Account.  Lifetime Elite Members will receive the benefits of Silver Elite, Gold Elite or Platinum Elite Members, which are subject to change from time to time as described in section 4.1.

4.2.f.  Lifetime Elite Status Criteria.  In 2018, Members can earn Lifetime Elite Status one of two ways:
