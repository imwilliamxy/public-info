se enter the 15/16 digit account number from the Mastercard, Visa, American Expr
ess, or Discover Card account that you want us to process a balance transfer fro
m. If the total amount you request exceeds the assigned credit line on your new 
account, we may either decline the request or send a partial payment to your cre
ditor(s). The amount of available credit on your new account will be reduced by 
the amount transferred and the related balance transfer fees. We reserve the rig
ht to decline to process any requested balance transfer. We will not process a r
equest to transfer a balance from any other account you may have with us. Balanc
e transfers incur interest from the transaction date. You should not transfer th
e amount of any disputed purchase or other charge. If you do, you may lose your 
dispute rights.Upon approval of your application we will process the requested b
alance transfer payment to the account(s) which you have requested on the 10th d
ay after we've mailed you your card; during this 10 day time period you may canc
el your balance transfer by contacting us at the number on the back of your card
. A balance transfer may take up to 4 weeks to post to your other accounts. Cont
inue to pay each creditor until the balance transfer appears on the other accoun
t as a credit. If you would like to complete a balance transfer from another acc
ount that is not a Visa, Mastercard, American Express or Discover Card account, 
please call the phone number on the back of your new credit card once you are ap
proved. Balance transfers are subject to availability. We may deny balance trans
fer requests at any time and for any reason.Avoiding Interest on Purchases: We w
ill not charge you interest on any purchases if you pay your entire balance by t
he due date each month. In addition, during this introductory period we will not
 charge you interest on purchases if you pay by the due date each month your out
standing statement balance minus any new 0% introductory APR Balance Transfer ba
lances. To avoid a late fee, you should pay at least the minimum payment due on 
your account each month.Credit Limit: We do not permit applicants to request a s
pecific credit limit. We do not consider a request for a balance transfer made w
ith an application to be a request for a particular credit limit. We determine t
he credit limit on your account independent of and prior to processing any balan
ce transfer request.Cash Equivalent Purchases: The purchase of money orders, tra
velers' checks, foreign currency, lottery tickets, gambling chips, wire transfer
s and other similar transactions are treated as cash advances. Please see your C
