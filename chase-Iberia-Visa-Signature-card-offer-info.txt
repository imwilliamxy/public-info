Rewards Program Agreement: For more information about the Iberia card rewards program, view the latest Rewards Program Agreement Opens in a new window. We will mail your Rewards Program Agreement once your card account is established. If you become a Chase Online customer, your Rewards Program Agreement will also be available after logging in to chase.com Opens in a new window.
How you can earn Avios points: You'll earn Avios points on purchases of products and services, minus returns or refunds (collectively, the "purchases"), made with an Iberia credit card by you or an authorized user of the account. Buying products and services with your card, in most cases, will count as a purchase; however, the following types of transactions won't count as a purchase and won't earn Avios points: balance transfers, cash advances and other cash-like transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting transactions, any checks that access your account, interest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if applicable. 3 Avios points: You'll earn 3 Avios points for each $1 spent on flight purchases made directly with Iberia, British Airways, LEVEL, and Aer Lingus. 2 Avios points: You'll earn 2 Avios points for each $1 spent on hotel accommodations when purchased directly with the hotel. 1 Avios point: You'll earn 1 Avios point for each $1 spent on all other purchases. Information about earning/transferring Avios points to Iberia: Avios points earned during a billing cycle will be automatically transferred to Iberia after the end of each billing cycle. Avios points expiration: Avios points will expire according to the Iberia Plus Program Terms and Conditions which include maintaining Iberia Plus program activity for 36 consecutive months. Losing Avios points: You'll immediately lose all Avios points that haven't been transferred to Iberia if your Iberia credit card account status changes, or your Iberia credit card account is closed for program misuse, fraudulent activities, failure to pay, bankruptcy, or other reasons described in the terms of the Rewards Program Agreement. Rewards Categories: Merchants who accept Visa/MasterCard credit cards are assigned a merchant code, which is determined by the merchant or its processor in accordance with Visa/MasterCard procedures based on the kinds of products and services they primarily sell. We group similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers to you. Please note: We make every effort to include all relevant merchant codes in our rewards categories. However, even though a merchant or some of the items that it sells may appear to fit within a rewards category, the merchant may not have a merchant code in that category. When this occurs, purchases with that merchant won't qualify for rewards offers on purchases in that category. Purchases submitted by you, an authorized user, or the merchant through third-party payment accounts, mobile or wireless card readers, online or mobile digital wallets, or similar technology will not qualify in a rewards category if the technology is not set up to process the purchase in that rewards category.
