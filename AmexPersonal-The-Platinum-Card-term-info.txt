How We Will Calculate Your Balance: We use the Average Daily Balance method (including new transactions).

Variable APRs for each billing period are based on the Prime Rate published in The Wall Street Journal on the Closing Date of the billing period. The Wall Street Journal may not publish the Prime Rate on that day. If it does not, we will use the Prime Rate from the previous day it was published. If the Prime Rate increases, variable APRs will increase. In that case, you may pay more interest and have a higher Minimum Payment Due. When the Prime Rate changes, the resulting changes to variable APRs take effect as of the first day of the billing period. Variable APRs are accurate as of [CURRENT_DATE].

To be eligible to earn the 70,000 Membership Rewards points, you must be enrolled in the Membership Rewards Program at the time of the eligible purchases. 70,000 Membership Rewards points will be credited to your account after you charge a total of $5,000 (the "Threshold Amount") or more of purchases on your Platinum Card® from American Express within the first 3 months of Platinum Card Membership starting from the date your account is approved. Eligible purchases can be made by the Basic Card Member and any Additional Card Members on a single Card account. Eligible purchases are purchases for goods and services minus returns and other credits. The following purchases do NOT count towards the Threshold Amount: fees or interest charges; purchases of travelers checks; purchases or reloading of prepaid cards; purchases of gift cards; person-to-person payments; or purchases of other cash equivalents. Points will be credited to your Membership Rewards account within 8-12 weeks after you meet the Threshold Amount. If we in our sole discretion determine that you have engaged in abuse, misuse, or gaming in connection with the welcome offer in any way or that you intend to do so (for example, if you applied for one or more cards to obtain a welcome offer(s) that we did not intend for you; if you cancel or downgrade your account within 12 months after acquiring it; or if you cancel or return purchases you made to meet the Threshold Amount), we may not credit Membership Rewards points to, we may freeze Membership Rewards points credited to, or we may take away Membership Rewards points from your account. We may also cancel this Card account and other Card accounts you may have with us. Terms and Conditions for the Membership Rewards® program apply. The value of Membership Rewards points varies according to how you choose to use them. Your Card account must not be canceled or past due at the time of fulfillment of any offers.

You can earn 70,000 Membership Rewards points after you spend $5,000 or more in eligible purchases on your card within your first 3 months of Card Membership starting from the date your account is approved. In rare instances, your period to spend $5,000 may be shorter than 3 months if there is a delay in receiving your Card. Also, purchases may fall outside of the 3 month period in some cases, such as a delay in merchants submitting transactions to us or if the purchase date differs from the date you made the transaction. (For example, if you buy goods online, the purchase date may be the date the goods are shipped). Points will be credited to your Membership Rewards account within 8-12 weeks after charges appear on your monthly billing statement and after you meet the spending requirement.

$200 Airline Fee Credit
Benefit is available to Consumer, Corporate Platinum, and Business Platinum Card® and Centurion® Members only. To receive statement credits of up to $200 per calendar year toward incidental air travel fees, Card Member must select one qualifying airline at www.americanexpress.com/airlinechoice. Qualifying airlines include Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Spirit Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and United Airlines. Only the Basic Card Member or Authorized Account Manager(s) on the Card Account can select the qualifying airline.

Card Members who have already selected one qualifying airline will be able to change their choice one time each year in January at www.americanexpress.com/airlinechoice or by calling the number on the back of the Card. Card Members who do not change their airline selection will remain with their current airline. Statement Credits: Incidental air travel fees must be charged to the Card Member on the eligible Card Account for the benefit to apply. Incidental air travel fees charged by both the Basic and Additional Card Members on the eligible Card Account are eligible for statement credits.

Incidental air travel fees must be separate charges from airline ticket charges. Fees not charged by the Card Member's airline of choice (e.g. wireless internet and fees incurred with airline alliance partners) do not qualify for statement credits. Incidental air travel fees charged prior to selection of a qualifying airline are not eligible for statement credits. Airline tickets, upgrades, mileage points purchases, mileage points transfer fees, gift cards, duty free purchases, and award tickets are not deemed to be incidental fees. The airline must submit the charge under the appropriate merchant code, industry code, or required service or product identifier for the charge to be recognized as an incidental air travel fee. Please allow 2-4 weeks after the qualifying incidental air travel fee is charged to your Card Account for statement credit(s) to be posted to the Account.

Membership for Global Entry or TSA Pre✓® is per person, and a separate application must be completed for each individual.

For additional information on the Global Entry or TSA Pre✓® programs, including information regarding the application and/or approval process and for a list of participating airlines and airports, as well as the full terms and conditions of the programs, please go to www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/global-entry for Global Entry and www.tsa.gov for TSA Pre✓®.

Please allow up to 8 weeks after the qualifying Global Entry or TSA Pre✓® transaction is charged to the eligible Card account for the statement credit to be posted to the Card account. American Express relies on accurate transaction data to identify eligible Global Entry and TSA Pre✓® purchases. If you do not see a credit for a qualifying purchase on your eligible Card after 8 weeks, simply call the number on the back of your Card.

Spending Limits
When you request that we apply a limit as described below on Charges incurred by an Additional Card Member on your Account, you agree to these terms. These terms supplement, and are incorporated by reference into, the terms of your Card Member Agreement.

At your request, we may agree to apply a limit to the total dollar amount of Purchases, during each billing period, that are charged to Card numbers associated with one or more specified Additional Card Members on your Account. At your request, we may agree to apply a limit to the total dollar amount of cash access transactions at ATMs, during each billing period, that are made using Card numbers associated with one or more specified Additional Card Members on your Account. If we agree to apply a limit, it is not a guarantee that the Additional Card Member will be able to make Purchases or cash access transactions up to the applicable limit. In applying any limit we will not take into account any credits (such as for returned merchandise or for payments), even if a credit relates to a Purchase made by the Additional Card Member. Any request that we change a limit may not be effective until a subsequent billing period. Any Charges (as defined below) incurred by the Additional Card Member prior to the date during a billing period that we apply the limit will not be subject to the limit for that billing period.

Because of systems or administrative considerations, arrangements with merchants, or for other business reasons, we may, but are not required to, treat some Purchases and/or cash access transactions (collectively, Charges) as not being subject to any such limits. You agree to pay all Charges without regard to whether any Charges exceed a limit, and you agree that we are not liable to you or any other person when a limit is not applied to any Charges and/or when Charges are incurred and billed that exceed a limit. While we typically require merchants to obtain an authorization for purchases and submit final transaction documentation for payment in a timely manner, a limit may not apply or may be exceeded when a merchant does not obtain an authorization for any reason; when a merchant obtains an authorization for a partial amount of the final charge submitted to us for payment; or when such submissions are not submitted or processed at the same time that the authorization is obtained. Examples may include, but are not limited to: Charges made outside of the U.S., in duty-free stores, or on board airplanes or cruise vessels; international airline ticket Purchases; vehicle rentals; lodging stays extended beyond original reservation period; certain mail order Purchases; Purchases billed on a recurring basis; Purchases at gas stations; telecommunications charges, including charges incurred with calling cards; taxicab charges; security deposits; late, damage or other fees in connection with rentals; Purchases billed in installments; restaurant tips and other gratuities; and Charges that occur before the end of billing period, if the Charge is posted to your Account after the Closing Date of that billing period. Any limit will not be applied to Charges for foreign currency or for travelers cheques or gift cheques obtained other than by telephone from us.

The Spending Limit for the Additional Card Member(s) is optional. If no Spending Limit is set on the Additional Card, spending capacity on this Card will be subject to the Basic Card Member's account terms and conditions.
Split Feature
The split feature ("Split") is only available in the American Express App® to Card Members with an eligible Card. Enrollment required. Eligible Cards include personal American Express Cards issued by a U.S. banking subsidiary of American Express that are not canceled. Prepaid Cards and products, American Express Corporate Cards, American Express Small Business Cards and American Express-branded cards or account numbers issued by other financial institutions are not eligible. To use Split, you must have or create an account with PayPal or Venmo and link your American Express Online Account to your PayPal or Venmo account.

With this feature, you can split purchase amounts that correspond to eligible purchases that are identified in your American Express App and made with an eligible Card. You split these purchase amounts with friends and family by making customized requests to be paid back using your linked account with PayPal or Venmo. Eligible purchases must be at least $1.00 and do not include cash advances or any fee owed to us, including annual membership fees. You cannot split purchases in a Plan It balance. To use Split, you must select an eligible purchase and provide the contact information for friends or family to whom you would like to send a request to be paid back. The total purchase amount will be divided between you and the contacts you select, and requests will be sent to each contact using your linked account with Venmo or PayPal. If a request is accepted, the requested amount will be applied to your linked account with Venmo or PayPal. Your Card Account will be billed for and you are responsible for paying the full purchase amount regardless of whether a request is accepted or rejected. American Express is not responsible for whether requests are accepted and money is paid back to your linked account with Venmo or PayPal. You will earn rewards for purchases that you split in the same way that you would for other purchases that you make with your Card.

Split will be available for a limited time. We plan to launch enhanced features after September 2020 that will require your re-enrollment. We will notify you if and when these features become available.

Upgrade with Points Terms and Conditions
When you use Upgrade with Points to request an airline ticket upgrade, three things will happen: (i) If the airline upgrades your ticket(s), your Card Account will be charged for the upgrade; (ii) American Express will deduct the Membership Rewards points you offered for the upgrade from your program account; and (iii) American Express will apply an accompanying credit to your Card Account for those points. If the airline upgrades your ticket(s) and the number of points available in your Membership Rewards program account is less than the number of points you originally offered, American Express will deduct only the number of points available and you will receive an accompanying credit only for that number of points. The credit to your Card Account may appear during a different billing cycle than the charge for upgrade. You are still responsible for paying the amount due on your Card statement by the due date. Any applicable taxes and fees in connection with an airline ticket upgrade will be charged to your Card Account and cannot be covered with points. The value of the points you offer is determined at the time your upgrade offer is accepted by the airline and may change after your upgrade offer has been submitted if you subsequently upgrade or downgrade your Card Account. Once accepted by the airline, your upgrade offer is nonrefundable, non-changeable, and points cannot be returned to your Membership Rewards program account.

Each airline determines whether to accept upgrade offers and which upgrade offers it will accept based on factors it determines in its discretion, including the amount of an offer. While it is possible for airlines to accept an upgrade offer at any time after offer submission, most upgrades are processed between 5 and 1 days before departure, and some are processed as close as 1 hour before departure. If your flight reservation includes tickets for more than one passenger, the tickets for all passengers on the reservation will be upgraded if your upgrade offer is accepted by the airline. If you would like to upgrade only certain passengers, you must contact the airline to split your reservation prior to requesting an upgrade.

If your Card offers additional points for flights purchased directly from an airline, you will not receive additional points for your upgrade purchase.

Participating airlines' Terms & Conditions apply. Participating airlines are subject to change at any time without notice. Participating airline products and services are subject to change. American Express reserves the right to cancel any upgrade offers or discontinue the Upgrade with Points program at any time.

If you use a Pay Over Time feature for a purchase using Upgrade with Points, the statement credit you receive may not be applied to that feature. Instead, it might be applied to your Pay in Full balance. If you think this has happened, please call us using the number on the back of your Card.
Using Points for Charges
Using Points for Your Charges is only available to Basic Consumer and OPEN Card Members enrolled in the U.S. Membership Rewards® program. Additional Card Members, Authorized Additional Card Members, and Corporate Card Members are not eligible. Account managers and Rewards managers may be eligible to use points by calling the number on the back of your Card but are not eligible to use points online. All Linked Card Accounts must not be canceled, past due or have a returned payment outstanding. A minimum of 1,000 Membership Rewards points in your program Account is required and you may use Membership Rewards points only toward the entire amount of an eligible charge. American Express will present the eligible charges you can use points towards, and we may change which charges are eligible at any time without notice. American Express is under no obligation to make charges available for redemption using Membership Rewards points. For each transaction, points will be debited immediately from your Membership Rewards program Account and a credit will be issued to your Linked Card Account for the corresponding dollar amount within 48 hours. Credits processed after the Card Account's statement closing date will appear in the following billing period. You are responsible for payment of the amount due on your Card Account by the due date even after using this feature. To learn about this feature and redeem points online, visit membershiprewards.com/yourcharges.
