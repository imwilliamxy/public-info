    As a one-time bonus each calendar year, once you reach $25,000 in purchases 
you will receive 10,000 bonus miles. Purchases are when you, or an authorized us
er, use a card to make purchases of products and services, minus returns or refu
nds. Buying products and services with your card, in most cases, will count as a
 purchase; however, the following types of transactions won't count and won't ea
rn bonus miles: balance transfers, cash advances, travelers checks, foreign curr
ency, money orders, wire transfers or similar cash-like transactions, lottery ti
ckets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting transactions, a
ny checks that access your account, interest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges
, and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if applicable. Purchases you ma
ke with other United credit cards prior to becoming an Explorer cardmember will 
not count towards the $25,000 requirement. "Calendar year" means January 1 throu
gh December 31 of that same year. For your first year as an Explorer cardmember,
 calendar year means the period beginning with your enrollment date through Dece
mber 31 of that same year. Therefore, you will have from your account open date 
through December 31 to earn the one-time bonus in your first year. Please allow 
up to 6 weeks after the billing cycle in which you qualify for bonus miles to po
st to your MileagePlus account.

s: Merchants who accept Visa/MasterCard credit cards are assigned a merchant cod
e, which is determined by the merchant or its processor in accordance with Visa/
MasterCard procedures based on the kinds of products and services they primarily
 sell. We group similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making re
wards offers to you. Please note: We make every effort to include all relevant m
erchant codes in our rewards categories. However, even though a merchant or some
 of the items that it sells may appear to fit within a rewards category, the mer
chant may not have a merchant code in that category. When this occurs, purchases
 with that merchant won't qualify for rewards offers on purchases in that catego
ry. Purchases submitted by you, an authorized user, or the merchant through thir
dparty payment accounts, mobile or wireless card readers, online or mobile digit
al wallets, or similar technology will not qualify in a rewards category if the 
technology is not set up to process the purchase in that rewards category. For m
