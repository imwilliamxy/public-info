ies: Merchants who accept Visa/MasterCard credit cards are assigned a merchant c
ode, which is determined by the merchant or its processor in accordance with Vis
a/MasterCard procedures based on the kinds of products and services they primari
ly sell. We group similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making 
rewards offers to you. Please note: We make every effort to include all relevant
 merchant codes in our rewards categories. However, even though a merchant or so
me of the items that it sells may appear to fit within a rewards category, the m
erchant may not have a merchant code in that category. When this occurs, purchas
es with that merchant won't qualify for rewards offers on purchases in that cate
gory. Purchases submitted by you, an authorized user, or the merchant through th
ird-party payment accounts, mobile or wireless card readers, online or mobile di
gital wallets, or similar technology will not qualify in a rewards category if t
he technology is not set up to process the purchase in that rewards category. Fo
