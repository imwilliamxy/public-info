                                                                      Rewards Pr
ogram Agreement: For more information about the Amazon card rewards program, vie
w the latest Rewards Program Agreement. We will mail your Rewards Program Agreem
ent once your account is established. If you become a Chase Online customer, you
r Rewards Program Agreement will also be available after logging in to chase.com
. The terms of the Rewards Program Agreement apply to the 3% Back and 5% Back ea
rned at Amazon.com and Whole Foods Market including physical Whole Foods Market 
store locations, 365 stores, and the website accessible at wholefoodsmarket.com.
                % Back and Points: "% Back rewards" are the rewards you earn und
er the program. % Back rewards are tracked as points and each $1 in % Back rewar
ds earned is equal to 100 points. You may simply see "% Back" in marketing mater
ials when referring to the rewards you earn. Eligible Prime memberships only app
ly to Amazon.com accounts (and not accounts on any other affiliated websites out
side the U.S.) and may include, in Amazon's sole discretion: annual and monthly 
Amazon Prime subscriptions and members of their Amazon Household (excluding Amaz
on Prime Video and invited guests of an Amazon Prime account), Amazon Prime Fres
h, Amazon Family, Amazon Prime Student and trial memberships of Amazon Prime.   
             How you can earn points: You'll earn points when you, or an authori
zed user, use an Amazon Rewards Visa Signature or Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Sign
ature credit card to make purchases of products and services, minus returns or r
efunds. Buying products and services with your card, in most cases, will count a
s a purchase; however, the following types of transactions won't count and won't
 earn points: balance transfers, cash advances, travelers checks, foreign curren
cy, money orders, wire transfers or similar cash-like transactions, lottery tick
ets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting transactions, any
 checks that access your account, interest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, 
and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if applicable.                Whe
n you earn 3% Back at Amazon.com and Whole Foods Market: If the Amazon.com accou
nt through which you apply for your card account does not have an eligible Prime
 membership, your card account will earn 3% Back on Amazon.com and Whole Foods M
arket purchases.                Your card account will earn 5% Back instead: If 
the Amazon.com account through which you apply for your card account has an elig
ible Prime membership and your card account is loaded into that Amazon.com accou
nt. If you switch Amazon.com accounts, use multiple Amazon.com accounts, or your
 card account is loaded into multiple Amazon.com accounts, then your card accoun
t may not automatically earn 5% Back and may instead earn 3% Back. In such cases
, you will need to confirm your card account number and select your card account
 on that Amazon.com account with eligible Prime membership in order to earn 5% B
ack. To learn how, visit the "Manage Payment Options" page via "Your Account" pa
ge at Amazon.com. Once you've confirmed and selected your card account, your car
d account will then earn 5% Back on Amazon.com and Whole Foods Market purchases 
until that Amazon.com account with eligible Prime membership:                   
     (i) no longer has an eligible Prime membership;        (ii) no longer has y
our card account loaded in that Amazon.com account;        (iii) is closed;     
   (iv) is used to select a different card account to earn 5% Back at Amazon.com
; or        (v) is used to apply for another Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature
 card account that is approved and loaded in that Amazon.com account (that new c
ard account will earn 5% Back at Amazon.com).                Whether a purchase 
earns 3% Back or 5% Back is determined at the time your eligible Amazon.com or W
hole Foods Market purchase is made.                Earning % Back Rewards: You'l
l earn either 3% Back or 5% Back for each $1 of eligible purchases made using yo
ur card account at Amazon.com and Whole Foods Market, as described above. 3% Bac
k equates to $0.03 in % Back rewards, which is equal to 3 points, for each $1 sp
ent. 5% Back equates to $0.05 in % Back rewards, which is equal to 5 points, for
 each $1 spent. 3% Back or 5% Back is earned only on purchases made at Amazon.co
m (including digital downloads, Amazon.com Gift Cards, Amazon Fresh orders, Amaz
on Prime subscriptions, and items sold by third-party merchants through Amazon.c
om's marketplace) and Whole Foods Market (including physical Whole Foods Market 
and Whole Foods Market 365 stores, and the website accessible at www.wholefoodsm
arket.com). 3% Back or 5% Back is not earned on (i) purchases from merchants usi
ng Amazon Pay, (ii) purchases made at international Amazon retail sites (includi
ng but not limited to Amazon.ca, Amazon.co.uk, Amazon.de, Amazon.fr, or Amazon.c
o.jp), or any other website operated by Amazon, (iii) purchases made at internat
ional Whole Foods Market sites, (iv) purchases of Whole Foods Market or Whole Fo
ods Market 365 products or services through third-party sites such as Eventbrite
, Instacart, Google Express and Shipt, (v) online purchases of Whole Foods Marke
t or Whole Foods Market 365 gift cards (including through buyatab.com), event ti
ckets or classes, (vi) purchases from certain third-party vendors operating at W
hole Foods Market sites, (vii) purchases of massage services at any Whole Foods 
Market site, or (viii) purchases from Spa@Ink, in each case in Amazon's sole dis
cretion. You'll earn 2% Back for each $1 spent in the following rewards categori
es: restaurants; gas stations; drugstores. This equates to $0.02 in % Back rewar
ds, which is equal to 2 points, for each $1 spent. You'll earn 1% Back for each 
$1 spent on all other purchases. This equates to $0.01 in % Back rewards, which 
is equal to 1 point, for each $1 spent. We may offer you ways to earn bonus poin
ts through the program or special promotions. You'll find out more about the num
ber of bonus points you can earn and any other terms at or before the time of ea
ch eligible offer.        How you can use your points: You can use your points t
o redeem for eligible purchases at Amazon.com. You can also use your points to r
edeem for cash, starting at 2,000 points, through an account statement credit or
 electronic deposit into an eligible checking or savings account held by a finan
cial institution located in the United States. Other redemption options include 
travel, gift cards, and products or services made available through the program 
or directly from third party merchants.        Points expiration/losing points: 
Your points don't expire as long as your account remains open, however, you will
 immediately lose all your points if your account status changes, or your accoun
t is closed for program misuse, fraudulent activities, failure to pay, bankruptc
y, or other reasons described in the terms of the Rewards Program Agreement.    
            Rewards Categories: Merchants who accept Visa/MasterCard credit card
s are assigned a merchant code, which is determined by the merchant or its proce
ssor in accordance with Visa/MasterCard procedures based on the kinds of product
s and services they primarily sell. Chase groups similar merchant codes into cat
egories for purposes of making rewards offers to you. Please note: Chase makes e
very effort to include all relevant merchant codes in its rewards categories. Ho
wever, even though a merchant or some of the items that it sells may appear to f
it within a rewards category, the merchant may not have a merchant code in that 
category. When this occurs, purchases with that merchant won't qualify for rewar
ds offers on purchases in that category. Purchases submitted by you, an authoriz
ed user, or the merchant through third-party payment accounts, mobile or wireles
s card readers, online or mobile digital wallets, or similar technology will not
 qualify in a rewards category if the technology is not set up to process the pu
rchase in that rewards category. For more information about Chase rewards catego
ries, see www.chase.com/rewardscategoryfaqs.        Using your Points at Amazon.
