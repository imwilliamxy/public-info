How you can earn points: You'll earn points when you, or an authorized user, use an IHG® Rewards Club credit card to make purchases of products and services, minus returns or refunds. Buying products and services with your card, in most cases, will count as a purchase; however, the following types of transactions won't count and won't earn points: balance transfers, cash advances and other cash-like transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting transactions, any checks that access your account, interest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if applicable. 25 points on IHG properties purchases for the entire first year: You'll earn 25 points for each $1 spent on purchases made at InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) properties, including InterContinental® Hotels & Resorts, InterContinental Alliance® Resorts, Kimpton® Hotels, Crowne Plaza®, Hotel Indigo®, Holiday Inn®, Holiday Inn Express®, Holiday Inn Resort®, Holiday Inn Club Vacations®, Staybridge Suites®, Candlewood Suites®, EVEN™ Hotels and HUALUXE™ for your first 12 months from account opening. After that you'll earn 10 points for every $1 on IHG properties. The bonus 15 points earned are in addition to the standard 10 points (to make up the total of 25 points) and will appear on your billing statement in a separate line. 4 Points on all other purchases for your entire first year: You'll earn 4 points for each $1 spent on all other purchases for your first 12 months from account opening. After that you'll earn 2 points for every $1 spent in the following rewards categories: gas stations; grocery stores; restaurants; and 1 point for each $1 on all other purchases. The bonus 2 or 3 points earned are in addition to the standard 2 points in the rewards categories or 1 point on all other purchases (to make up the total of 4 points) and will appear on your billing statement in two separate lines. 10,000 bonus points each account anniversary year: You'll receive 10,000 bonus points each account anniversary year during which at least $20,000 is spent, and one additional purchase is made at least one day after you have spent $20,000. "Account anniversary year" means the year beginning with your account open date through the first statement after the anniversary of your account open date, and each 12 billing cycles after that. Information about earning/transferring points to IHG Rewards Club: Points earned during a billing cycle will be automatically transferred to IHG Rewards Club after the end of each billing cycle. Points expiration: The points transferred to your IHG Rewards Club account will not expire as long as there is IHG Rewards Club program activity for 12 consecutive months, depending on your status. IHG Rewards Club Membership terms and conditions apply. For complete program details, visit ihgrewardsclub.com Opens Overlay . Losing points: You'll immediately lose all points that haven't been transferred to IHG Rewards Club if your card account status changes, or your card account is closed for program misuse, fraudulent activities, failure to pay, bankruptcy, or other reasons described in the terms of the Rewards Program Agreement. Rewards Categories: Merchants who accept Visa/MasterCard credit cards are assigned a merchant code, which is determined by the merchant or its processor in accordance with Visa/MasterCard procedures based on the kinds of products and services they primarily sell. We group similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers to you. Please note: We make every effort to include all relevant merchant codes in our rewards categories. However, even though a merchant or some of the items that it sells may appear to fit within a rewards category, the merchant may not have a merchant code in that category. When this occurs, purchases with that merchant won't qualify for rewards offers on purchases in that category. Purchases submitted by you, an authorized user, or the merchant through third-party payment accounts, mobile or wireless card readers, online or mobile digital wallets, or similar technology will not qualify in a rewards category if the technology is not set up to process the purchase in that rewards category.
