cards, statements, and notifications will be sent to the name and address on fil

you have a relationship with the person or people whose name(s), address(es), an
d date of birth(s) you've told us, that all their information is correct, and th
at you have their consent to add them. If Chase determines you've given us fraud
ulent name, address, or date of birth information, or did not have such consent,
 Chase can close this account.
